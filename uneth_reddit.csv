Buy something expensive with the card and immediately return it. If you buy something for $800 and get a fast refund, I think many cards will assume the $800 credit as a partial payment of your monthly bill. Then you'd just need to pay the other $200 to be current on your payments.

You still owe the money but this way you can defer payment for a while. At least it seems like this happens when I get refunds and my ""amount due"" on my credit cards go down because of it.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1580351053,Green-Sleestak,13,1,True,2020-01-29

ULPT: Spend $100 for a lifetime of $5 phone cases,"Alright, I just realized I should post this here and I'm cooked to shit so bear with me. Lifeproof cases are decent enough rugged protection cases; dust/waterproof and shock resistant to a pretty good height. They have a lifetime warranty policy for their cases that states if anything goes wrong with one they'll replace it free of charge to back some quality guarantee. When I called them all I had to do was give the serial number of the case and my card info to pay a $5 shipping fee or some shit. They never asked for proof of purchase or anything. I decided to try replacing it again when I got a new phone some time later, and it worked!

Me and housemate 1 agree we don't want it, we've said this in person and online in our group chat. Housemate 2 left the group chat, and shouted in person just saying ""I've got nothing to say about it"". We havent spoken to housemate 2 in about 4 days, since she shouted, and just live our lives around each other.

First of all our house has ONE TOILET. Housemate 2 didn't clean up after her last parties. Housemate 2 proposes party is just a ""predrinks"" and everyone will leave by 11, she's thrown 2 parties before that had the same claim but resulting party showed otherwise,with people staying until 1am (we live in a very residential area, our neighbours are elderly and the other side has kids aged 5 and 7). I've let her have 2 parties before, me and housemate 1 have never done parties. I'm in my third year of uni and need to concentrate on work, but housemate won't hear reason. 

My boyfriend suggests turn the main power off so no lights or anything? 
I'm thinking call the police on the night and file a noise complaint? Or bolt the door so people can't get in? Can't imagine the door would be able to hold against 50 people though.

ULPT Request: Get Rid of Sister’s Asshole BF / I don’t live in her city,"Hi everyone! My sister reached out to me a couple of days ago, upset about her boyfriend. She is 20 and met this guy about 3 months ago in one of her college classes. After one month, she tells me she loves him. After two months, she tells me she’s effectively living at his apt (no longer going to her dorm). After 3 months, he bought her a cat. 

She’s not talking to her friends, and she feels “disconnected” from school, her part time job, and even from us (according to our convo two days ago).  

Her bf: 21, one misdemeanor for drunk in public / drinking underage, works full time while going to school. He drinks heavily, and he’s started saying cruel comments to her once he’s drunk, then he passes out. He also pressures her into taking care of the house. When he’s not drunk, he sends her belittling articles and gets passive aggressive with her until he gets what he wants. 

The dilemma: she’s going back and forth about leaving him, and after our convo, he promised her he would stop drinking. I remember when I was her age, I absolutely would not listen to anyone who told me to leave an asshole bf. I don’t want to call the police / I know from experience it’s not at that level yet. I have their location, I can find out where he works easily. I do not live in their city but I can get there semi regularly. I will not do anything illegal, I’m here for shiesty suggestions.

"ULPT: In the UK and need a second secret/disposable contact method? Buy an 07 mobile number from AAISP, set it to forward to an email address.

As you can run WhatsApp Business alongside standard WhatsApp, you effectively have a secondary communication method which you can burn by simply deleting the app. Alternatively, some version of Android phones support dual messenger.

The number cannot be called &amp; once you delete WA Business - all communication stops. If SMS messages are sent, they'll just land in the email inbox you can keep logged out of your phone.

ULPT Getting out of DirecTV and Uverse contracts :),"Hey there! I've known this trick for a while, and while I don't need it anymore, I thought I should share to hopefully help out someone else!

AT&amp;T and DirecTV will let you out of their TV/internet service contracts if you're moving and the service is not available at your new address.

All you have to do is call customer service, let them know you're moving, give them the new address, they'll run it thru, and when they realize it's not available, you just act disappointed until they let you know they're going to cancel your contract.

Uverse internet and TV is pretty easy because there's lots of places they don't service for those products, DirecTV is a lot harder b/c they are willing to smack a satellite pretty much anywhere lol but it's still doable if their system does not recognize your address.

In order to find an address that's not available for any of their products, I started w/ a map of broadband coverage at [https://geoisp.com/us/](https://geoisp.com/us/) \- found an area in Texas where there's absolutely nothing, middle of nowhere, Flower Mound TX. Pulled up [realtor.com](https://realtor.com/) searched up Flower Mound, filtered search to land for sale. Found an address that looked pretty simple, but with photos that looked like it was definitely just a lot of dirt and nothing else. You can check uverse availability on the website [https://www.att.com/availability/](https://www.att.com/availability/). It will always say you can get DirecTV though, so w/ that you just have to wing it. I used to know someone who worked for AT&amp;T so they were able to check my address thru the system before I made my call, so you could do that if you're able. Otherwise, just try it. Call them up, if they ask questions, you can say its a new house you just built, whatever they say just try to be really friendly, a bit vague, and pretend you genuinely want your products moved (ie; don't sound like you're trying to cancel lol). When they realize services are not available, I usually just pause, sound really bummed and say something like ""damn okay, what do we do now?"" don't mention the contract, they will deal w/ that when they begin the cancellation. If you run into any roadblocks, or feel like you're getting the wrong results, don't hesitate to hang up, or say ""shit sorry I have another call coming through I'll have to call back later"" etc. Most of the time, I was able to get the job done on the first call but occasionally I had to try back and get a better rep.

Hopefully this helps! Let me know if you have any questions and I will try to answer :)",UnethicalLifeProTips,1580407460,a-spacekitten,0,1,True,2020-01-30
ULPT: Company won’t stop sending you spam messages? Find a phone number connected to them and spam them back.,"Just spent the last half hour calling this company Lendingtree that won’t stop sending me text messages and calling me about a mortgage deal for a house I don’t own. Every time someone picked up I would shout epithets and otherwise unpleasant things and hang up. Rinse and repeat. 

They tried to retaliate by spamming me with endless blocked calls. Turns out you can’t do shit on an iPhone while someone is calling you without declining or answering. So I answered, muted, and found out that If you block a contact with the phone number “000-000-0000” they can’t do that. Continued to spam them with nasty shit until I tried again and their system dropped my call after the promoter. 

This only really works if you have some free time and aren’t around other people but I’ve been using it for years now. Lendingtree is just the most recent asshole to decide to send spam calls.

ULPT: Using Desperate People for Money,"As a previous AskReddit thread brought to my attention, there's a lot of people so desperate for love in this world they're willing to pay extortionate amounts of money if they feel they're being loved. It's not even too difficult to get them to this point, all you have to do is consider it an investment. Now it may be quite a long term investment as you'll likely have to speak to them for several months for an hour or two most nights at least before they're willing to send any significant sums in your direction. However if you can manage to talk to several lonely souls at a time this becomes quite lucrative. 

Now it gets better, as these people aren't exactly few and far between, especially because you find massive communities right here on Reddit. r/foreveralonedating for example. If you visit the sub you'll even see that the moment a woman posts she's flooded with attention from lonely guys, often with decent jobs and decent lifes that could afford to pay for her lifestyle. Obviously it comes with saying to play smart if you follow up with this and I in no way condone this act but making a good fake profile and using cropped photos that can't be reverse image searched can go a long way and make you a lot of money if you do it well but the real difficulty will also be making sure you don't mess up with the money because you don't want your bank account being shut for fraud.

How to sell it: if you can make yourself go pale or bright red it’ll be helpful. I hold my nose and blow like I’m trying to pop my ears to turn my face bright red for a minute. Speak a bit quietly like you’re embarrassed. If you can vice grip a counter it’ll add to the overall. DO NOT ask for the bathroom, say “do you have some water or something I can splash on my face?

Yes, I know no one faxes anything any more, however certain companies etc still require it for some unholy reason as they’re that far behind the times. My friend works in an office and has a single sheet of black construction paper that he uses whenever someone calls them saying they didn’t get something yet, despite him faxing it multiple times.

• 1/2 cup peeled, blanched Almonds

• hot (not boiling) water

• 2 cups white sugar

• 1 tsp salt

• ½ oz Orange Blossom Water

Put the almonds in a quart-sized mason jar and fill with hot water. Let macerate for one hour, then drain the water out, reserving the nuts. Put the nuts in a blender with the sugar, salt, and 2 cups hot water. Blend on high for one minute. Fine-strain through a nut bag or cheesecloth (a cloth napkin works in a pinch), pressing to extract all of the liquid. Add the Orange Blossom Water to the strained mixture, stirring in to mix.

"ULPT: When employees at Walmart ask for your receipt, you have no legal obligation to show it to them.","So theoretically, even if you’ve shoplifted or fudged some things at self check out, you can keep walking. They will ask you to stop, they may raise their voice, but it’s illegal for them to touch you. Just simply say “no thanks I don’t have time” and keep walking. Don’t slow down, don’t make eye contact. If they lay a finger on you, you have a lawsuit. So just book it to your car as fast as you can. 

1. Obviously I wouldn’t do this at a Walmart that you visit often. 

2. This won’t work at membership based stores such as Costco because it’s in your contract that you consent to receipt checks and searches when asked.

I've tried yelling over him but I'm a quiet person and simply can't yell loud enough. We've asked the neighbours if they hear the yelling but they say they don't. When we confront him about it he keeps using the same ""it's funny"" excuse.

I don't want to do anything illegal such as break or steal his stuff, but it's effecting all of our mental health and I don't know any other way to stop him.

The 10 yr old has taken to random liberties of everything not hers. I could go on for days. I’ve taken to just avoiding them but this almost backfires as they get horrible when I’m around or my stuff is out.

Parents do nothing to stop this behavior but “talk to them” and the behavior returns usually within a week. 

10 yr old is into art and I’ve been asked if I messed with her stuff before when I hadn’t so that’s already on the radar. 30 yr old is half special and only into the dude she sleeps with and he’s abusive to her. All I really want is my stuff left alone and be able to use the common areas without a fight. But I suspect pushing back would cause them to make everyone’s life hard.

ULPT: How can I completely fuck over my neighbor?,"How can I completely fuck over my neighbor

Looking for some advice on how to deal with my piece of shit neighbor.  I’ll try to get as much detail as possible. 

I live in a rural area on my grandparents property with basically only 2 neighbors in sight. One across the river and one about 30 yards away. My issue is with the one closest to me. The owner of the house isn’t so bad, keeps to himself and is quiet. But this idiot has a twin brother (mid 50’s) and is a real piece of work. 

I personally suspect he’s snooping around my property and night and when we’re not home but nothing has shown such. He’s shot at my chickens, and shot near my grandpa whilst shooting chickens. (While they were on our property) 

He honks every time he drives by my house? I don’t get it but it’s a daily thing, and annoys me.  

He lives in a little shack on his brothers property I believe, or on the couch sometimes but even his brother doesn’t let him have his own space in the house. 

A few years ago he somehow managed to talk my other grandparents into letting him stay there for little to no rent and eat all the food and stink-up the house. 

Now I’m looking for ways I can ruin this guys day/week/life. Anything helps


EDIT: Don’t respond if you’re going to tell me to get a dog, or film the snooping. I’m looking for something UNETHICAL",UnethicalLifeProTips,1580245821,iAmCleatis,53,7,True,2020-01-28

I know the IRS has matching records and will see I have other W-2's but a quick google search says they would pay me out the return but send me a request for an amended tax return that included the other 2 and id have to pay them.

I have another friend who makes money by approaching people, next to their car. He asks if it's their car. If they say yes, he holds a tool meant to break windows next to the window, and tells them, ""If you don't want to go to the garage, and pay hundreds to fix the windows, give me a 100 Euros, and you won't have to go through the trouble, and I won't break your windows.""

He’s not good with electronics, so after a few times he gets annoyed and goes to bed. Otherwise I have to listen to him being loud for hours.

ULPT Request: My neighbor has turned the neighborhood into a bird sanctuary and it is driving me up the walls.,"My neighbor had numerous bird feeders in his back yard that attracts hundreds of birds.  I'm not exaggerating.   There are a lot of trees around my house and all my neighbor's houses.   You know what the bird sanctuary at the zoo sounds like?  That's what it sounds like walking outside my house.  I took an audio recording from my back porch [https://voca.ro/6RSwJiPBnYb](https://voca.ro/6RSwJiPBnYb) (excuse the audio quality, I just used my cellphone to record it).   I can hear them inside with all the doors and windows shut.   I also have a huge weed problem from all the birdseed being spread everywhere around my property.  I live in an otherwise very quiet neighborhood.  The occasional dog barking doesn't bother me, but the super high pitch birds that are constant all day every day drive me insane.   I work from home sometimes and can't concentrate with all the birds.  

Things I've tried so far: 
Talking to the neighbors about it as nicely as I possibly can.   They just frame it like I'm some crazy person that doesn't like the birds.

After talking with the neighbors didn't work I tried a device that plays predictor bird calls.  The birds just ignore it.  

I have neighbors that have indoor out door cats that roam around the neighborhood, the birds pay no attention to them.  The neighbors also put up fences around the bird feeders to keep cats out and they trap squirrels.   

Animal control will do something about barking dogs, but they can't do anything about wildlife that is attracted to the neighborhood.  

The other thing is I have neighbors behind me and to the other side that are very quiet and respectful.  The one behind me only lets their dogs out one by one so they don't bark and bother the neighbors.

The fact of the matter is it's just plain and fucking simple, moral principals. They frame it in such a bullshit way. 

So here's the fine print on how I can cancel - any body have any suggestions? 

(1) If you are unable to use your Subscription for three consecutive months as a result of a medical condition (provided that Regal may require you to provide documentation acceptable to Regal of such condition); or 

(2) you move to a permanent address outside of the United States, Guam, Saipan or American Samoa (provided that Regal may require you to provide documentation acceptable to Regal of such new address).

(3) If I passed away.

-He doesn't have a job. Of course, no income not even paying for rent, food or anything

My wife is a bit.. sympathetic (probably not at the right person) to his brother, letting him live with us in a different rooms in the house. Her family comes from a poor background or less than middle-income background.

No fucking way, because this POS brother in law of mine never gets a steady job. Got 3 different jobs last year, all lasted a month before he quit. And I never saw him put any effort to find another job or at least a job that he won't quit.

Mother-in-law totally left the care of his son to my wife, by that, also to me.

When you get your credit card bill, there are usually a few ways to pay it.  

1. Minimum payment - this is the absolute lowest payment you need to make.

2. Statement balance - the amount you need to pay so that you don’t get charged interest. This is the total that you had when your billing cycle ended.

3.  Your current balance - everything you owe.

We want to look at option 2.  When you get the statement, you will have $xx.xx to pay if you don’t want to accrue interest charges. 

If you owe a $500 statement and you have to pay $400 this month to avoid interest, buy something so a charge goes through.  Let’s say $300.  When the payment clears, return it for a refund.  


Now you still owe $500, but what you owe to avoid interest is now lowered to $100.

I'm a sales guy in a position best described as a business broker. I take clients full cycle from prospecting -&gt; transaction close. Transactions in the Ms.

I've recently been promoted from a role with compensation based around activity (e.g. $X per meeting set w/ the boss) into a role based around commission for the transactions themselves. 

This is great, but the caveat to this situation is my salary/commission structure has been danced around but never formalized. With two of my accounts coming to a close this week I feel like I need to go into that commission negotiation table with a good footing.

&amp;#x200B;

My challenge is that it's difficult to ascertain what is 'normal' in this industry -- Everyone's very cagey about it because no brokerage really wants to reveal what cut the get/give out. It's not the sort of sales position that you can Google information about, as far as I can tell.

Is there a round-about way to try and find out what I should be asking for? Obviously asking for too little is just as dumb as asking for way too much.

The vast majority of people don't buy expensive scotch and will not be able to taste the difference (and frankly there isn't really much of taste difference between Blue Label and Black Label anyway, especially not enough to justify the price difference IMO.)  As long as they watch it getting poured from the Blue Label bottle, the placebo effect should do the rest of your work for you.  Just be sure to ""unseal"" the bottle and pour the first drink yourself before you let anyone else handle the bottle.

Chances are good the ports used by this program will be open for everyone, no matter if you try to break free from the company network or get within the company network.

Most of the times you can email that portable version just to yourself. If the server filters it, try a password protected zip-file and rename .zip to .pup or something else that's not a valid extension.

You should now be able to connect to your PC at home via an encrypted connection that looks just like another support session.

This might work with less user friendly remote administration tools like Ultra VNC, Tight VNC and what have you, but I can not document them all.

They will probably mark your gender as female (or a category that's equivalent to female in terms of how it will influence your rate), so you may pay less money for car insurance. This is how the current system works with the insurance company that's ""like a good neighbor"" and has a red and white logo (as of 6 months ago).
 
I'm not recommending trivializing trans peoples experience (which is probably what you'd be doing).

"ULPT: Want to sell your Steam account but you're facing tough competition? Just report them to Steam, and get their account banned.","The most important thing to remember about this is that it's against [Steam's Subscriber Agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) to sell your Steam account. So if anyone finds a way to prove that you are trying to sell your account, they can simply report you, show proof and Steam will ban you quickly.

-

Smart sellers will not post any details about their account that could identify them (ex: Account name, Username, SteamID64/32, Invite URL, Account ID, etc.), and will simply edit these things out of [SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/) and [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/calculator/).

-

Another thing to keep in mind is that the linked profiles in the seller's ad may simply be decoy accounts. What happens here is that the user describes their account (games they have, account level, etc...) in the ad's description, but posts a screenshot of a different account (probably not even theirs). In these cases, the seller is probably ""testing the waters"" to see if trying to sell their account at that place will get them banned.

-

In cases like these, and where the seller has blocked all info that could identify them, create a burner account on that website and pretend that you're an interested customer who would like to buy their account, but first needs to see what games are on that account and requires proof that the info in the ad is correct, and that the account is not banned or a decoy by asking them to link their profile (be assertive here, say that someone tried to scam you before and you're ""playing it safe"", force them to use [SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/) and [SteamDB's calculator](https://steamdb.info/calculator/) and give you a screenshot of the results to prove it's the account they're trying to sell, and pretend that you're ignorant of the fact that Steam can ban you if you're trying to sell your account when you ask them for their profile link so they can relax and think you're some idiot from who they can easily gain money from, and who won't report them. It's up to them if they wish to lose a customer and potential revenue over a slight paranoia that they'll get banned, that's why we exploit that).

-

The goal here is to identify their real account to be able to report them, and if you're unable to do that, get as much other information about them as you possibly can (things like; account creation date, profile picture, profile level, total number of games owned, total number of friends they have, ban info (do they have any VAC ban or not), etc...) all of it which can be gained from SteamRep and SteamDB screenshots. You're doing this so you can gather info about them that you will send over to [Steam Support](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithCommunityContactSupport) (or somewhere else like /r/Steam, where some moderators frequently visit) so that Steam employees will be able to pinpoint their account with these details (the more you give, the easier it will be for them).

-

**REPORTING PROCEDURE**

The reporting procedure is really easy.

Before reporting, make sure that you take screenshots of everything as proof of what they're doing. This includes:

- The ad they placed
- Chat logs
- The Steam account they linked in their ad/chat

Instead of taking screenshots, an alternative is to use [archive.is](https://archive.is/) (just paste the link, and press '**save**', wait for the process to finish, and voila!).

Once you've gathered all the evidence you need:

- Go to their profile page (if you're sure that's their real account)
- Click on the large **More** button in the upper-right corner of the page
- Select **Report Profile** from the dropdown
- Select the **They are involved in theft, scamming, fraud or other malicious activity** option
- Follow it with **They are engaged in item theft or scamming**
- Select **Submit this account for review** and say how they're trying to sell their account which violates [Steam's Subscriber Agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/), give them evidence of it and press **Submit Report**

If you didn't manage to identify their Steam account, go to [Steam Support](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithCommunityContactSupport), select **Contact Steam Support** at the bottom of the page, and provide them with all the info that you can about that user.

-

Now sit back, and wait.

-

**P.S.** Steam receives around a thousand reports a day, so don't expect the ban to happen instantly. Give it a week or two. Even if the account is sold at that time, the customer will probably be outraged and try to get their money back to buy from another seller and give a negative score to the other one.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1579469480,vulk21,3,1,True,2020-01-19
ULPT Request: How do I get Jehovah’s Witnesses to stop coming to my house and writing me letters?,"For the past few years, different Jehovah’s Witnesses have been coming to our neighborhood knocking on our doors to witness to us. They frequently leave pamphlets. I’ve tried not answering the door.  I’ve tried firmly telling them I’m not interested and to leave us alone but this continues. We have had our house broken into before and sometimes have problems in the neighborhood so it is extremely scary to have people ringing my doorbell. One guy even did it repeatedly in the rain just to leave a pamphlet. It always seems to be different Jehovah’s Witnesses. Most recently I received a letter in the mail addressed to me personally. It wasn’t addressed to my husband but to me. In this handwritten letter it’s asking me all sorts of personal questions about the future and the world. The person left their name, address, and phone number. I’m afraid if I call and ask them to stop, I will be put on some sort of list to be harassed even more.

ULPT The reverse fake I.D.,"When I was 19 I went to Thailand with my friends, and in Bangkok, found many vendors on the streets selling fake I.D's of decent quality. I purchased one saying that I was 17 so that when I returned home to Canada, I could purchase a ""youth"" seasons pass to my local mountain for the snowboard season. This alone saved me nearly $500 and the I.D was less than $20 Canadian. I went on to pay the youth price for haircuts, movies, amusement parks, gym pass, and buss passes all year long. It saved me well over $1000. but the best part? I got arrested for pissing in an alleyway with a beer can in my hand. Cop found my fake I.D. Did I go to jail? No, of course not. He drove me to my parents house, which I hadn't lived at for over a year, because it was the address on the I.D. and after telling my dad how I needed some more ""discipline"", he promptly left. My dad, confused as hell, asked me why the hell he brought me to his house and not the drunk tank. When I showed him the I.D his knees nearly buckled he laughed so hard.

"ULPT: Sick of that faulty business card tip? Try printing stickers with your target's social media / website instead. Guaranteed nasty results, regardless of believability...","Informed from real experiences, but -

I'm sure everyone's seen that 'save a business card of someone you don't like for leaving [fraud] contact advice in car accidents'. Even if this did work - your goal isn't to get out of a minor accident (else you could just leave **no** note, right?) - clearly the intent is to put your target on the hook for some random harassment. Let's step up the game.

Swap those business cards out for some stickers. [Eggshell vinyl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfGFzxgYek) is a real game-changer, but hey, you'll probably get the same results just off paper labels from the office supply store.

Print some social media links on that shit, and slap it on everything. Car windshields, rear vision mirrors, windows...hell, maybe even the front door and letterbox of a few random houses.

Sure, your business card tactic may piss off that one guy until he (easily) disproves that it's a false accusation - but with a handful of stickers, you can guarantee that your target is gonna get all manner of angry messages from potentially dozens of people. It literally doesn't matter if they did it or not if it's the only contact details listed.

Sure, it won't get you off the hook when you back into a BMW in the carpark - but that business card thing won't either. But if your goal is to get a target harassed by people who are angry at something they didn't do?

"ULPT: Craigslist horse ""Free to Good Home?"" Eat that bad boy.","Craigslist horses are occasionally sold VERY cheaply or given away for free. Look for them in the Farm and Garden section (or just search Horse on the main page). 

Horse meat is actually not only delicious, it's very lean and healthy, more so than beef. Horses are often eaten in other countries, not so in the United States because they grow slower than cows and are ""companion"" animals. But you don't care!

Animals of that size usually dress out to roughly 50% of their weight on the hoof. A 1200 lb horse will yield about 600 pounds of meat. Even if you were to grind the whole thing into hamburger, that's the equivalent of $2,400 worth of meat. 

**Important: when you initially call the owner, ask if the horse has received any medication recently.** If so, google the medication to find out if you might poison yourself if you eat the horse. 

You will need to be able to dispose of a big-ass skeleton, hide, and pile of guts and sinew. 

You will need to borrow a horse trailer to get the horse, as showing up with a flatbed trailer and a tarp might make the owner suspicious that his horse isn't going to a happy place. You will also need a hammer or gun to kill the horse, and a winch to get his heavy dead horse ass off the ground to start gutting, skinning, and quartering him. You'll need a flat surface, knives, and a shit ton of ziploc bags to contain your horse meat, and a heavy-duty grinder if you want to burger-ize him. If you've never butchered an animal, get help from a fellow unethical who has. You'll need a huge freezer to contain your horse meat.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1579275092,RoyalPea-ness,0,1,True,2020-01-17

We were newly dating after being FWB for a year, and I was cleaning his room (being paid, as it was a massive undertaking), while he fixed his car outside. I came across a pair of small bikini underwear, while sorting dirty laundry - ""Oh hell no. Ugh. Whatever, it's just one pair, it's probably from before we even met,"" I reasoned to myself. Kept going. 


Another pair! 


""Okay now I'm getting pissed off. I don't wanna touch another bitch's grungy old panties, I'm going to need about $10million more for this shit"", I told myself.


Kept going, reluctantly...oh. cool. THREE pair next to each other. The fuck???? 


I gathered them up, stomped outside, confronted him. He seemed bewildered by my anger. ""Oh, I can deal with those if you don't want to touch my underwear...?"", he offered. 


""Oh right, yeah, you wear women's panties now? Give me a fucking break, do you think I'm stupid? I think this would've come up before now, considering everything else we've done"" I wasn't getting played, not today! 


He gently led me back into the house, muttering angry words under my breath the whole way. He sat in front of his computer and started pulling up files. ""I swear to God if you show me pictures of some bitch you fucked I will flip this table"", I promised. He found what he was looking for: pictures from years before we met, when he was scrawnier and flexing in a dirty mirror in the same underwear I'd found. They were all the same brand, size, and style. 


I felt like a fucking dumbass.

Usually this wouldn't be a problem if there weren't SO MANY OF THEM that it makes parking on my street a nightmare. The problem lies in the fact that since they mainly practice cohabitance due to monetary restrictions, my street gets very crowded when school is back.

ULPT Request - R6 Season 4 Gift Card Return,"There’s some background to this, and I would really appreciate some help. 

I really enjoy playing Rainbow Six. It was my birthday on Monday. Well, my brother only had $50, but wanted to get me something. He’s awesome, and spent a good deal of time earning this cash through snow shoveling, household chores, and helping our neighbors. 

He decided he wanted to buy me a season pass for R6. He doesn’t play it, so didn’t understand Season 4 was ending. It’s marked for $30USD at Target, and he bought it. 

When I unwrapped it, I smiled and thanked him a ton. I knew I’d have to return it, but I really appreciated the thought and considerable amount of money (From his perspective) he put into it. 

Today while I was at school, my mom went to return it. Now, listen. My mom and I are both extremely introverted. She doesn’t like returning things she legitimately has an issue with. For example, a shirt that was too small, she just wrote it off on herself making a mistake. I knew that going up to the return desk took a great deal of courage for her. I appreciate her a ton. 

The Target receipt said non-refundable, but she was hoping we could eventually swap it out for the new Season Pass, or they’d be understanding. Nope. The lady at the desk said that, “You should’ve read the back of the card, and knew the season would be over soon. Your fault, not ours.”

Generally, I wouldn’t argue with a store. But the problem I have is, **Do you really think a 45 year old woman, and 13 year old kid who know nothing about Rainbow Six would read the fine print on the back?** It’s not about the money. It’s about the principle of it now. 

Here’s the information I have: It’s a gift card for Season 4 of Rainbow Six, valued at $30USD. I have the receipt. (It does say “Non-refundable” on the receipt.) The gift card was purchased at Target. Target ‘suggested’ we contact Microsoft, who said since we didn’t buy it online, we’d have to talk to Ubisoft. (The developer) I’ve sent them an email explaining my situation, but I’m not hopeful.

ULPT REQUEST: Leveraging Auto Warranty,"This is probably a little vanilla for this sub but is very real and if it works may benefit a lot of people. 

I recently financed a car from a small dealership with no warranty. Today I took it in to a reputable certified mechanic as it was making a noise I disagreed with. It was diagnosed with a critical transmission failure. It still drives but reccomend a rebuild or replace. 

It occurred to me to research what's known as Vehicle Service Agreements (VST). These are warranties provided by a third party. This would cover the transmission replacement. The total cost of the warranty is much less than the repair quote. 

Stipulation: The warranty can't be used for 30 days and 1k miles after it begins, to prevent what I'm about to propose. 

I called a few today, they ask for the mileage. It is only verbal, no inspection. 

What if I claim 1k miles less than what I have, park the car, wait a reasonable amount of time, and claim the 1k miles have passed? Has anyone successfully won over on a warranty before? 

I'm headed to bed and apologize if this is too lame, but I can't afford the repair. I'll check back in the morning.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578979004,clendestine,1,1,True,2020-01-14

ULPT: Looking to catch a vulnerable girl on the rebound? Buy and sell used furniture on Craigslist.,"This one comes from a personal experience. I had just ended a long term relationship and was looking to buy and sell some furniture to adapt to my new apartment (as I had just moved out of a place with my girlfriend). One girl wanted my bedside table and came to pick it up. She was very attractive and clearly a bit down. After some casual flirting and helping carry it to her car I asked if she wanted to get a drink sometime. She had also just ended a long term relationship and that’s why she needed new furniture. Turns out what we both needed was a consequence-free fuck.

ULPT: Someone doesn't pays you back? Sell off their debt!,"If someone borrowed a small amount of money and despite you trying doesn't pays it back you can try to sell of their debt. This works excellent when you have a paper trail or if the borrower und buyer both where present when he borrowed the money initially.

Example: Friend A borrows $20 from you, friend B sits next to it. You get tired of asking your money back. Next time when A and B are present you remind A that he still owes you $20. And then you offer friend B, who is known to be annoying and persistent to buy his debt for $10.

If he agrees you get part of the money back and you don't have to worry about it any more, friend B can annoy friend A (friend B loves that anyways).

Best case: You got some of your money back and friend A learns that he can't put you off for an infinite time

Worst case: You see that nobody wants to buy his debt, not even with a great discount, and you realize that the money is lost, you should stop worrying about it and never lend something to said person again.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578949593,ProfessionalDish,6,1,True,2020-01-13
Starbucks Hack,"My normal drink at Starbucks is cold brew with soy milk. If I were to buy this straight up, it would run me around $4 for a grande. Instead, I get a grande iced green tea with extra ice (no added water or sweetener if you like the tea flavor). This runs me $2.76 in my state. Because of the extra ice, I can drink the tea in maybe 1-2 minutes. I then get a free refill (Starbucks app requires) but with my cold brew with soy.
In all, it saves me about $1.25 every time I have a Starbucks craving, and I get a green tea appetizer as well. 

I’m currently studying for the MCAT so I’m at Starbucks pretty frequently, so it’s saved me a good chunk of change.

I would normally have spent a couple days trying to fix it but, having just bought a house and inundated with /projects/chores, I figured it was time for an upgrade.

We found the perfect tree online at an orange big box hardware store but they had been all sold out since black Friday.  (Of course one seller has 10 of the trees on eBay for $200 above msrp pls shipping)

Went to the store to try and get a decent replacement but not all the trees were on display. None of them had enough lights except for one in the box, not on display. 

Got it home and was immediately disappointed. The quality was shoddy, the base wobbled, and there were several branches with no lights on them at all.  

Called up HD and they said I could bring it back in January as long as I had the receipt.  

So, buy the tree before, return the tree after; always have a new tree!

1 - Driver photo doesn’t match driver. You can even take a picture from the backseat and just make sure to only get his back side. Uber takes this super seriously and will ban the drivers indefinitely usually within a day. 

2 - Make complaint towards drivers car. Possibly talk about how the brakes squeak bad or how the driver refused to turn on the air conditioning / heater. 

3 - Almost no drivers follow speed limits exactly. Just take a video of a straight road and slightly speed it up and say you felt unsafe. 

4 - If you really wanna get them banned for life say you saw an open container of alcohol in the driver side compartment or that he smoked a cigarette before you got into the car.

ULPT: If you are in or going into college get married in order to get a better financial aid package.,"This one works in the USA I'm not sure about the laws elsewhere. To apply for financial aid at American universities you fill out a fafsa. The fafsa uses you and your parents income  to calculate the amount your family can afford to contribute to your tuition. The calculation is bullshit it doesn't take into account siblings,  cost of living, or whether or not your parents actually intend to contribute. Regardless the FAFSA expects you to include your parents income. However you can avoid including your parents income if you are married, with the landmark supreme court case Oberfell vs. Hodges it is easier than ever to get married. Find a friend who also wants a better aid package, make an appointment at the courthouse, and sign some paperwork. I recommend a solid prenup just incase once of you turns out to be a major dick, you can find solid prenup templates online that you can sign and have notarized while you are at the courthouse. As long as you can avoid banging your new partner until you are out of college you are also eligible for an annulment, which will set your legal standing back to single (this has occasional legal relevance and is the ideal situation) 

For this to work you may need to fill out an additional form with your school which explains why you have a sudden change in family income so that you don't trigger a fraud or accounting issue in your schools financial aid office. Also fill out your FAFSA as soon as it is available as financial aid is often available on a first come first serve basis, especially Pell grants which are going to be your bread and butter with this trick. 

I can confirm that this method works in practice, the brothers in the prelaw fraternity at my school all got married to one another in 2015. They all got basically 50% or better covered off of their tuition. 

Make sure you have a reason prepared just in case your financial aid officer asks why you married so young or suddenly, arranged religious marriage is easy and convenient, thus shouldn't be a problem but it doesn't hurt to be prepared.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578838289,squirrelbee,0,1,True,2020-01-12

ULPT Request - Please share your Anonymous weed buying experience?,"&amp;#x200B;

\-&gt; Throw away for obvious reasons. 

\-&gt; TL;DR at the end.

Hi guys, decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle. And I'm really in need of some advice, as well as your experience. 

So a little about me: 

I’m a foreigner that recently moved to a Nordic country, and currently reside and work in a small town(4000ppl) 800km away from the capital. I work for a minimum wage, which is ok, but not enough and decided to sell weed as a side hustle. I do not speak the local language, but I'm learning it. I communicate mostly in english, and because of that I'm mostly known as “The Foreigner” among the locals, which always puts me under attention :)

The Opportunity

Due to the distance from the capital and scarcity in general the price of weed here is x2 - x3 times more expensive \~35-45usd per gram. A hefty profit margin, and since there are not that many attractions, people tend to smoke consistently. The market is under-saturated and I think that 150g-300g a month are easy to manage. 

Already in touch with an in bulk dealer/grower, that could supply consistently and only requirement is to drive once a month to the capital and back.

The Problem

Because i’m new to town, language barrier and the locals being nationalistic selling directly would put me in a very bad spot. Suspicion and rumors spread here like plague and one wrong sale can put the cops on me very fast. Associating with someone is a no-go as with more participants the risk raises, and profit decreases. 

So I came to the conclusion of selling weed anonymously without interacting with the customer. So far I have a few creative solutions, but I'm not really sure if they are the best. So with your help i’m would like to explore your experiences of buying weed anonymously as well as get some feedback from my proposed schemes.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out the flaws in my ideas and complete them with a fresh look. 

Solutions that might or might not work

1. Scavenger method (unsolved cash payment)

Hiding the contents in a bunch of locations around the town, in special containers and in different dosages (0.5g, 1g, 2g, and 5g) and geotag them. Communicating with potential customers by anon apps such as telegram and sending them the geolink + picture where to find the hidden container. 

The problem is how to receive cash from the buyer in an easy and reliable way?! So that the buyer doesn’t go through an overwhelming process and keeps my anonymity at the same time.  

1. Key lock box (unsolved cash payment) [https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10O\_GkQZmBKNjSZPiq6xFNVXaq.jpg](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10O_GkQZmBKNjSZPiq6xFNVXaq.jpg)

Communication will be through an anon app such as telegram, once a deal is made send the buyer to a specific money drop-off point , after quick confirmation send them to another location where the lock is and send them the code after receiving payment.

The lock will be put in a new random place every time, after getting an order or confirming payment. 

The challenge with this method is the cash drop-off point. How to know that the buyer left the right amount of money in the right place without getting in contact with them. 

How to assure that no one is looking after the drop-off point to identify the person who will take the cash… is there a smart contraption that will assure that?! 

As another payment solution that will keep anonymity and less hassle to go and check for the right amount would be crypto currency. But the issue with crypto is that it is hard tedious process, involving registration, deposit of money to exchange accounts, withdrawal and confirmation time. It is a very elegant solution but it won’t compare with the experience of just giving cash to a dealer. 

Please share your experience of buying weed anonymously, and describe in detail how the process of payment(how did the seller get the cash anonymously) and how did you receive the product without compromising yourself. 

And also feel free to criticize and complete the proposed methods. 

**TL;DR**

Decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle in a nordic country with high profit margins. I need advice on how to do it efficiently without compromising myself, in receiving cash payment, and passing the weed to the buyer in such a way that will rival with the experience of buying weed from a dealer face to face. Have proposed 2 methods but are not yet complete. Your experience and criticism will help me a lot.

So I just walk a stop or two up the bus line where no one gets on. Bus is always empty there.

ULPT: What to do in order to avoid paying interest when you're behind on your credit card bill,"First of all a little backstory. I wanted a Nintendo Switch and some other random stuff for my PC so naturally I did what any other guy in his early 20's would do, I went into debt for them. A few months into my job I got approved for a credit card and the way it works is that if I spend something and put the money back within the same fiscal month I get no interest on it, pretty sweet deal. Also there's a list of retailers that have a deal with the credit card company and if you were to purchase from them you could use the bank's app to automatically have the purchase divided into 3 or 6 installments, again, with no interest. That's what I did, paid everything back as scheduled no worries.

Now of course, like any other 20 something year old with 0 financial responsibility and a credit card I went overboard one month, spent a little over a thousand dollars on ubering places, ordering out, going for drinks and had no way of putting it back. So of course I was gonna get hit by interest, right? Wrong.

What I actually did is go to that local retailer's website, the one I got my switch from, and order another thousand dollars worth of smart TVs. As soon as the purchase was approved and the money went through I used the in-app option to get 6 penalty free installments. I was now roughly 2000 dollars in debt, half of which was gonna get hit with interest when the month passed. I then called the retailer up, said I changed my mind and I no longer wanted the tvs, they cancelled the order and refunded the money to my credit card. The catch? I was still scheduled to pay my debt off in 6 interest-free instalments.

I don't think there's anything illegal here and as long as you have the same deal on your credit card you can probably do the same :\^)",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578675105,andreiweightloser,0,1,True,2020-01-10

ULPT Request: How to get my little brother's friends to stop wanting to sleep over.,"Okay, so my little brother's friends keep coming over our house to hang out.  I would not have a problem with this, but they take the only room with a TV and they stay over for pretty much the entirety of the time that I would like to use that TV.  I am also going to college and due to my schedule I am spending a lot of time on campus even when I am not taking a class.  Apparently they have ""no where else to go"" but I don't buy it.  It's probably just that no one else wants them over their house because they are loud throughout the night (isn't a problem for me).

I don't know what exactly they do down there.  I think I remember them saying that they play dnd, but that clearly isn't what they do for the whole night.  Furniture gets moved around and the place is always pretty messy the next morning.  They probably use the TV as well.  Not to mention the amount of noise throughout the night.  It is also important to note that I know next to nothing about his friends since they are relatively new.  All I can say for certain is that they are all Juniors in high school.

It is also important to note that my parents endorse my brother having his friends over.  They always buy them snacks and order pizza and stuff.  I don't have much of a problem with them coming over once in a while, but they are over too often nowadays and its getting bothersome.  Any advice on how to make my house a little less appealing?

So, if you were to have bad intentions with them, just order real expensive food from them, tell them that your dog loved it, oreder a bit more and stock up. Then after a few months, tell them that your pet passed and ask if you should send it back.      
⠀⠀⠀⠀  
If everything goes by plan, you should get your money back, be able to sell the pet food and probably get a nice flower boquet from them. Profit",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578700494,muwtu,5,1,True,2020-01-10

ULPT Store going out of business? Hide everything you want and come back when the sales and discounts reach their peak," I did this years back at a Bonton. Tried on a bunch of pants, hid them in the women's section right as the store had everything 10% off. Came back weeks later, got a few pair of Levi's for 70-80% off.

When Toys R Us was closing I stashed things in storage above merchandise, hid Switch games with the dolls, etc. If I remember correctly I flew too close to the sun with a Harry Potter wand and it was gone when the store was in their final week.

Things to keep in mind:  
\- When a store is closing they're short-staffed and are unlikely to do a lot of re-shelfing so you can hide things for a while. I recommend taking a picture of where you stashed an item so you don't lose it yourself.

\- If a store is to the point that they're closing off portions of the sales floor and selling display units, don't wait much longer. This means merchandise might be moved and sorted.

Always say it doesnt work anymore. You tried it in another phone - still nothing. Put your friends SIM in your phone - like a charm. Why? 

When you lose or destroy your SIM you are responsible for that and thus the replacement card will be billed but when you say its malfunctioning suddenly the ball is in the carriers yard. He has to ensure the service you agreed to by contract is provided and the SIM card not working is a violation of that. I have yet to hear from a carrier that he demanded you send the broken SIM in for analysis. Simply not worth it. The card costs below cents propably which is why most tell you to break it and throw it away. 

Most carriers use the exact same button to resend a new SIM. They just either add the billable charge or send it for free based on your statements.

Your Anonymous weed buying experience? I want to know.,"  


\-&gt; Throw away for obvious reasons. 

\-&gt; TL;DR at the end.

Hi guys, decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle. And I'm really in need of some advice, as well as your experience. 

So a little about me: 

I’m a foreigner that recently moved to a Nordic country, and currently reside and work in a small town(4000ppl) 800km away from the capital. I work for a minimum wage, which is ok, but not enough and decided to sell weed as a side hustle. I do not speak the local language, but I'm learning it. I communicate mostly in english, and because of that I'm mostly known as “The Foreigner” among the locals, which always puts me under attention :)

The Opportunity

Due to the distance from the capital and scarcity in general the price of weed here is x2 - x3 times more expensive \~35-45usd per gram. A hefty profit margin, and since there are not that many attractions, people tend to smoke consistently. The market is under-saturated and I think that 150g-300g a month are easy to manage. 

Already in touch with an in bulk dealer/grower, that could supply consistently and only requirement is to drive once a month to the capital and back.

The Problem

Because i’m new to town, language barrier and the locals being nationalistic selling directly would put me in a very bad spot. Suspicion and rumors spread here like plague and one wrong sale can put the cops on me very fast. Associating with someone is a no-go as with more participants the risk raises, and profit decreases. 

So I came to the conclusion of selling weed anonymously without interacting with the customer. So far I have a few creative solutions, but I'm not really sure if they are the best. So with your help i’m would like to explore your experiences of buying weed anonymously as well as get some feedback from my proposed schemes.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out the flaws in my ideas and complete them with a fresh look. 

Solutions that might or might not work

1. Scavenger method (unsolved cash payment)

Hiding the contents in a bunch of locations around the town, in special containers and in different dosages (0.5g, 1g, 2g, and 5g) and geotag them. Communicating with potential customers by anon apps such as telegram and sending them the geolink + picture where to find the hidden container. 

The problem is how to receive cash from the buyer in an easy and reliable way?! So that the buyer doesn’t go through an overwhelming process and keeps my anonymity at the same time.  

1. Key lock box (unsolved cash payment) [https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10O\_GkQZmBKNjSZPiq6xFNVXaq.jpg](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10O_GkQZmBKNjSZPiq6xFNVXaq.jpg)

Communication will be through an anon app such as telegram, once a deal is made send the buyer to a specific money drop-off point , after quick confirmation send them to another location where the lock is and send them the code after receiving payment.

The lock will be put in a new random place every time, after getting an order or confirming payment. 

The challenge with this method is the cash drop-off point. How to know that the buyer left the right amount of money in the right place without getting in contact with them. 

How to assure that no one is looking after the drop-off point to identify the person who will take the cash… is there a smart contraption that will assure that?! 

As another payment solution that will keep anonymity and less hassle to go and check for the right amount would be crypto currency. But the issue with crypto is that it is hard tedious process, involving registration, deposit of money to exchange accounts, withdrawal and confirmation time. It is a very elegant solution but it won’t compare with the experience of just giving cash to a dealer. 

Please share your experience of buying weed anonymously, and describe in detail how the process of payment(how did the seller get the cash anonymously) and how did you receive the product without compromising yourself. 

And also feel free to criticize and complete the proposed methods. 

**TL;DR**

Decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle in a nordic country with high profit margins. I need advice on how to do it efficiently without compromising myself, in receiving cash payment, and passing the weed to the buyer in such a way that will rival with the experience of buying weed from a dealer face to face. Have proposed 2 methods but are not yet complete. Your experience and criticism will help me a lot.

ULPT: Upstairs neighbors from hell? You need a megaphone.,"First things first, try using your words. If you’ve got a problem with neighbors you should talk it out, but if that doesn’t work then this works 1000x better than banging on your ceiling, which could also get you in trouble with the landlord. 

Personally I have a family above me, with two preteen kids who understandably fucking LOVE to run around and jump. I mean reliably 3-4 hours every night, sometimes up to midnight or rarely even later. I talked to the mother about this and offered to exchange numbers so I could directly inform her when I’m home and can hear the kids stomping. She politely told me to fuck off, her kids need to play and she pays for the floor too. I asked why she didn’t get a first floor apartment and she shut the door in my face. Good people of /r/UnethicalLifeProTips, I’m not lying when I say this stomping literally shakes my entire apartment so much that I can feel it through cushioned furniture and my plates and glasses rattle in the cabinets, it makes the apartment uninhabitable and happens EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. I can’t even have company over because of this. My downstairs neighbor, who I’m friends with, can also hear when the kids above me are going ape shit because they are that crazy and I guess the building is just that cheaply constructed so it travels two floors down. 

Fast forward a week and the landlord won’t do anything, I’m having zero peaceful nights at home and they just said the woman denied what I complained about, and also said I was randomly hitting my ceiling (false, it was in response to her kids). 

Long story slightly less long, I bought a cheap megaphone [and started blasting the siren feature into my ceiling air vents at full volume](https://i.imgur.com/MrkOD8r.jpg) when they’re being unreasonable. If I hear stomping I’ll give them 10 minutes or so to calm down/allow her to be a responsible adult and control her kids, and then just start blasting (for like 5 seconds). Pressing it against the vents keeps the sound from traveling around my apartment (and to my other neighbors) and just directs all of it into the ceiling, got the person below me to test it out and it completely overwhelms my entire apartment. So I know they get the message.

This has worked like a miracle for me. It even almost completely put an end to the unreasonable stomping, when it starts up now it will end within a minute or two, because they know what is coming. 

Like I said please talk to people first but holy shit if you end up in a situation like me, this will end it.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578447088,fairgburn,21,1,True,2020-01-07

ULPT: Getting rid of unsolicited dick pic senders,"So literally the worst thing is when you get a message out of the blue, and all it is is a guy’s dick. No context.

It should tell you exactly where the photo was taken, at what time, and a bunch of other info even including the type of phone that took it. 

Guys’ reactions to having their personal address sent to them in response to a dick pic is usually to get very freaked out, ask a bunch of questions about how you got their information, and immediately block you and stop responding.

ULPT - Get a free duplicate (or your money back) of nearly any item you order on Amazon,"The catch here is that multiple items need to be shipped together.  When the package arrives simply call their customer support and report that one of the items (the one you want for free or an extra of) wasn't in the box with the rest of the order.  They will send you a replacement or offer a refund with no information required beyond the last 4 digits of the order number.  I'm not sure if your account will get flagged after doing this often but it works flawlessly for a while at least.  


You can technically make a profit by ordering cheaper items to be shipped with the more expensive one, then asking for a refund of the more expensive item and also selling the one you received.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1578417384,MooseInNoose,6,1,True,2020-01-07
ULPT Request : Need revenge advice for boyfriend who cheated on me just after I lost both my parents," 

Quick recap - I posted last week about my boyfriend slowly fading while he went on vacation with his family during the holidays and ultimately blocking me on facebook. During this same time, I was at home burying both of my parents who had just passed within 2 weeks of each other.

I have definitive proof (tinder screenshots, instagram messages, etc) that he was in fact cheating on me. I haven't heard from him in 3 days but I have a feeling he will want his giant ass desktop computer back (that he built primarily for gaming, but it also has solidworks and other software, so I assume it took a lot of time and money to build, and on a broke college kid's budget he won't be making another one in time for his classes to start in 5 days).

I don't want to get into the details of how I found out because I will need this tool in my back pocket for future relationships lmao

But what should I do now with this information?

He comes back to town tomorrow.

Here is what I have been thinking

1. Message his tinder matches saying ""I have herpes""
2. Changing all tinder pics to ones with both of us
3. Changing his tinder to show only old men
4. Posting to his facebook page ""While my (now EX, because well I'm a sack of shit) girlfriend went home to bury both of her parents over the holidays, I spent the last 3 weeks getting my dick wet. Check out my moves \*insert pictures of conversations\*
5. Just telling him I'm pregnant to scare the shit out of him
6. Completely ghosting/blocking so he literally never gets his stuff back (primarily the computer, but he has his headphones (good ones), hiking shoes and backpack, coffeemaker, swimsuit, and dress pants at my place as well

Or any combination of the above!

I'm open to suggestions :)

Please don't tell me to grow up or get over it; I have zero intention of getting back with this asshole, I'd just like to end on a glorious note that makes him look and feel like the absolute sack of shit that he is.

ULPT How to “pass“ a police interrogation,"**1. Do not talk about things that the interrogator did not specifically ask you about.**

Most of the time guilty suspects will start to ramble on and on about things that aren‘t really connected to the question they were asked. They might do this because they are nervous or because they want to distract.

**2. Do not avoid conflict with the interrogator**

The interrogator will insinuate at some point that the police suspects you of committing the crime. They might tell you something like “You and [victim] weren’t on good terms, right?“ Guilty suspects will ignore this indirect accusation and start to downplay everything. An innocent suspect however will not ignore it and say something like “Yes, me and [victim‘s name] didn‘t like each other much but I didn‘t hurt/kill/kidnap  her/him. Are you trying to say it was me ?“

**3. Do not remove yourself from the situation**

Guilty suspects will unconsciously remove/detach themselves from the crime situation. A father who murdered his children for example will say “these kids/the kids“ instead of “my kids“.

**4. Be as honest as possible**

Even if you have committed the crime, try to be as honest as possible about the surrounding situation. Do not invent places/people or lie about dates/times when it is not *extremely* necessary. Otherwise this will lead to more questions which will lead to more lies.

**5. In the US the police is allowed to lie to you.**

In order to get a confession the interrogator might tell you that they have clear proof of your involvement in a crime, when in reality they only have some evidence. For example “we have an HD – surveillance photo of you at the crime scene“ when in reality it‘s just a blurry picture that wouldn’t be enough to incriminate you. 
In the UK this interrogation method is illegal but not in the US.

**6. Get a lawyer &amp; talk as little as possible**

A lawyer will most likely tell you not to say anything and to leave the interrogation if you can. That is why the interrogator(s) will try to distract you from calling a lawyer by acting ignorant, patient and non–threatening. 
This way most suspects won‘t feel the need to call a lawyer or leave the interrogation.

**7. Do not commit the crime**

I have been reliably informed that this is the best method to stay out of prison.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1577970199,Antipodin,21,1,True,2020-01-02

4. Ask an employee if they will price match and show the altered discounted price you set.

We got beer, and I used uber eats to get some wings and things. I ordered a chicken provolone grinder with bacon lettuce tomato cheese and mayonnaise. (Super tasty). 

The food came and all was fine but there was no chicken on my grinder, which is fine, I usually don’t even call or anything but since I am very poor at the moment I thought “fuck it, maybe I’ll get a refund and keep the food” so I decided I’d call. 

I got on the phone and told the guy my order was wrong, and he responded with “ok and..?” Which kinda was an annoying response (right?)
So I said “...and can you fix it?” He put me on hold for a few minutes then picked up again and told me to call uber, so I did, knowing they could do nothing because they didn’t forget to put the chicken on my sandwich. I called back and the same dude picks up, after realizing it was me started YELLING, “I have no time for this bullshit, call uber I’m not going to help you” and hung up.

ULPT: Two Major Plagarising Techniques,"If you don't have the time and money to complete a thesis, don't fret, for there is two major techniques I want to share for you to apply in plagiarizing your thesis. For copy and paste is the most common type of plagiarism used by students that are caught doing so. I advice not using copy and paste at all means except for quotes and citations.

&amp;#x200B;

   1.Online paraphrasers

There is a lot of free services online that lets you paraphrase sentences to paragraphs of text.Though its not 100% accurate in grammar, atleast all you had to do is skim and check for any errors in your altered text. All you need is a source, and then use these services to alter the words to avoid getting caught because of copy and paste. Here is a few recommendations I can give;

a. Google Translate - You might be surprised, but all you need to do is paste your text, translate it to a different language, and then translate it back, and bam, its words will alter and be paraphrased for you.

&amp;#x200B;

b. Quillbot(dot)com - Common choice for altering text, but I've heard its algorithm is too predictable and bigger schools usually are aware of this online service.

&amp;#x200B;

c. Paraphrasing-tool(dot)com - Its like quillbot, but I find it better when it comes to phrases with a more abstract meaning. It may use deeper words but its better than any paraphrasers I've used. Its still not perfect, but its good enough if you want to save time in paraphrasing words instead of doing it one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

   2.Wikipedia

Not just to use it as a data hunter, but at every article page there is a section called ""References"", so instead of citing the Wikipedia page, use these citations instead and you won't have to deal with teachers that discriminates wikipedia so much.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1577552589,Akira_Satoru,1,1,True,2019-12-28

ULPT: avoid pay wall in articles by clicking the button to stop the page load (right before it fully loads).,"Web pages are not made into a single file. Usually, it is a combination of _.html_, _.js_ and _.css_ files.

- **HTML** files contains meta data and text (your article);
- **JS (JavaScript)** files contains scripts to access and manipulate data and objects in the page;
- **CSS** files contains code responsible for the beauty of the site.

Because HTML **will be** the first one on the queue to download and run, basically, you only need to wait for it to download before hitting the stop button. You'll know only this file has loaded when there's just text on a white background.

At this point everything is ugly and may impact your experience. If you want some beauty, reload the page and wait a little bit more until the _.css_ and its beautifying code download.

Also, it's important to know that we're avoiding to download certain _.js_ files that trigger the pay wall, so avoid at all costs to download any file of this type.

**Disclaimer 1:** This trick is best used when you can't have ad-blockers installed or use Outline for whatever reason.

**Disclaimer 2:** It won't work sometimes because some web sites are clever enough to put the article text in a different place other then the HTML, forcing you to fully load their _.js_ files in order to read the text.

ULPT: How to use a fake account to get someone to accept your Instagram follow requests.,"1) Create an account with the same demographic of the person you want to follow. So, if your target is a white female who goes to x University, become a female student from x University, who happens to graduate the same year as they do. Make sure to put ""X University '21"" in your bio so they know that you go there! An easy way to do get a profile picture is thispersondoesnotexist.com, where you can pick out the face you want, and, bam, you're undeniably the person you claim to be. Because it's the internet, and you wouldn't lie.
2) Over a period of a few days, you'll need to manufacture your account to make it look like a well-seasoned veteran, and you want to be relatable to them enough so that they follow you. Ways to do this are
     a) post pictures of your travels to New Zealand over the summer, or your visit to San Diego over fall break. Of course these events didn't happen, but your target will think they did. Use pictures from Google to convince your victim that you definitely went to Lisbon in the fall. The purpose of this step is to make it seem as if your account is long term, as an account with 28 posts is more credible than an account with two or three. Yes, they might notice that your pictures were all posted in short succession, but they probably don't care enough about them anyway. And, by that point, you've already started following them.
     b) Use the #followforfollow hashtag to get free followers. This will also make your account appear more credible, as more followers makes you somewhat more attractive. (This may take some time and dedication, there are a large quantity of users who forget the follow back part.) If you're really desperate, make more fake accounts, and make them follow you, and each other.
     c) Make your account private, as that is what most users have it set to, and it will make your account appear more real. 
     d) Cater to them in your bio. I cannot stress this enough. Does your victim regularly attend a place that's big enough that they couldn't know everyone? You do too! Put it in your bio, discreetly. They might even think they know you. Does your victim like some musician? You love their songs! Drop a lyric in your bio! 
     e) Know your victim! One of my victims loves puns, so I made my username an egregious pun, just for the sake of winning her on my side. Are they a cat person? Mention that you have two!
3) Make an intriguing name. This one is not so necessary, but it's good to sound non-generic. 
4) Create a clever username. This can take time, but it's fun, at least, and it'll look good. I made mine a pun that makes me appear friendly.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1577077629,BlackFang4,7,1,True,2019-12-23

ULPT: How to successfully catfish,"Alright so this is a guide on how to be a successful catfish

What you will need: 

An iPhone (5-X) running 13.2.2 or earlier. If you want to use something newer, it can only be running 12.4 or earlier. You may use android devices but I cannot help with specifics

A Instagram account. This is the most time lengthy part. Youll need to work on building a normal looking instagram account. 

A Tinder account. You can use other dating app service but keep in mind, Tinder is the most popular one and doesnt require you to verify yourself.

A Snapchat account (you'll need to purchase one with a decently high score). Low scores can be red flags. ONLY INSTALL SNAPCHAT VERSION 10.56.0. More instructions below.

A iMac or Macbook that can run CheckRa1n. (

A host (someone very active on social media) that does porn work (I.E onlyfans, premium snap etc). If youre doing this as a girl, try to choose someone that isnt overly hot/popular

A phone service. You can go with a free texting app but honestly those arent very ideal. Better to pick up a SIM card from target/walmart/where ever and get a cheap pay-as-you-go plan. Theyre normally like $15 or $20 a month for unlimited texts which is all you need. REMEMBER to stay consistent. If the host youre using clearly is using an iPhone then youll need iMessage which cant be activated unless you have actual service. If your host uses android, thats fine you can disable iMessage. 

Turn off FaceTime to prevent any mishaps since its super easy to accidentally to hit answer if youre just playing with the phone. Facetime also connects super fast (you normally wont come across people that randomly try to FaceTime but better safe than sorry).

First off, you will need a phone that you will specifically use for catfishing. Its better to use a separate phone from your main phone because of what we'll have to do to it. I prefer using iPhones since iPhones generally have better jailbreak support than android devices. Not to mention, you have the extra option to use iMessage.

Jailbreaking:

Unfortunately, as of right now, you need a Mac to jailbreak iPhones 5-X. I mentioned earlier you could use newer iPhones, but Apple changed something in their code to where the software for jailbreaking those devices doesnt work. Use CheckRa1n to jailbreak. CheckRa1n is super easy to use so I wont be covering it. Just google it

List of jailbreaks youll need:

AppStore ++ (for installing an older version of Snapchat) 

Wraith (Snapchat tweak) As I mentioned above, youll need Snapchat version 10.56.0 and lower. Do not go any higher, Snapchat will ban you.

Relocate tweak. This is for spoofing your location as it is important to be in a completely different location as your host to avoid getting caught.

I think I covered everything. Now its up to you to get creative. Work on making your catfish completely believable. Remember to stay consistent with your story. Make whoever you're catfishing be comfortable with you. Send them normal selfies without them asking first. Try not to ask for nudes/talk sexual right off the bat. Have a normal conversation. Try posting normal everyday events to your story/IG account

ULPT: Need some extra cash in a pinch? Lie to your bank and they’ll give it to you.,"Here’s one I found by happy accident. Go to a bank and make a cash deposit at the ATM. After the deposit is complete call the banks hotline and complain that the ATM ate some of the money you deposited. You’re more likely to pull this off if it’s just one bill so say it was either a $20, $50, or $100 bill.  

The bank will apologize and immediately credit your account with said amount, with the disclosure that they will investigate the situation. If they find it to be untrue they’re within their rights to withdraw the money in 30 days. Thing is this is a common occurrence and $100 is chump change to just about any bank/credit union so 9 times out of 10 they’ll just grant you the money without issue. 

I should add that the best time to do this would be on a Sunday when the bank is closed. Most still have a hotline you can call on Sundays, if they don’t then even better, call back Monday.

"ULPT: if you want to find out whether your new boyfriend would be good with kids, don’t test on animals - try drunk people","Consider:

1. While on a date, you don’t just unexpectedly encounter unfamiliar animals in need of assistance - this isn’t a romance novel. Folks drunk off their arses are abundant if you know which places to go. Just make sure it’s a benign place and not the kind where people get stabbed. Unless you’re into that.

2. More close to life - small children and drunk people can be reasoned with roughly on the same levels, which is not much but significantly different from how one would reason with animals. Many absolute psychopaths and serial killers have been fond of animals, and gentle with them.

3. That is a human person - a surprising amount of people (I was going to say ”women” but who knows) figure that their partner’s ”parenting instincts” just instantly kick in when it’s *his* baby. That doesn’t really happen as strongly or often as you’d think, sometimes it’s just ”ok I don’t know you and I don’t like you and you just threw up on me, but if nobody else is gonna make sure you’re ok, I guess I gotta.”

In conclusion, shitfaced drunks are irrational, unpredictable, easy to find and the most important of all - technically speaking not even legally your responsibility, and therefore make an excellent 1st trial.

And my parents decided it was a good idea to ""limit the screen time"" by only letting me have internet in certain hours of the day. Now, this doesn't bother me THAT much because I have mobile data which I can use freely as much as I please. And my parents are fully aware of this. The fact that this change does literally nothing but piss me off from slow buffering really proves the effectiveness of their tactics. Oh and what pisses me off more is that they never even gave me a warning for this. They didn't sit me the fuck down like a normal human being and talk about any issues they had.

Now I don't want to come off as some kiddo complaining about his internets or whatever, even though that's kinda what I am and what I'm doing. Just the fact that I'm a FUCKING ADULT who can manage MY OWN TIME on MY OWN TERMS and my parents completely sweep it aside is complete bullshit. They believe this is the right thing to do to get us off those pesky pesky screens.

1) I'm not getting off my screens, I have data

2) I'm a fucking adult

3) my pleas and rants are deemed useless against the parental units, and I desire an alternate solution to get my routine back on track

I gots CenturyLink and a samsung galaxy s10+. If there's anyone who knows some way to bypass the security or set up some weird hotspot or something then help please and many thanks

ULPT WIPER BLADES,"A purely speculative way to ensure having wiper blades that work/don’t make noise.

As the title suggests, this is all purely speculative, and it can neither be denied or confirmed that it works.

Basically I’m sure the general consensus would all agree that the lifetime of wiper blades all suck ass and that they should last a lot longer. 

I mean sure, ~50 bucks for a pair of blades that last about 6 months isn’t too bad in regards to financial terms, they should still last a bit longer. By a bit longer I mean at least (can’t put enough emphasis on at least) a year.

With that being said, my tip involves three easy steps to assure having up-to-date wiper blades at no cost to you! 

(Step 1) Buy a pair of new wiper blades and install them. 

(Step 2) Slide the the plastic protector (that came with the new blades) over the old ones, pack them into the the packaging from the new blades(along with the instructions)

 (Step 3) Go back to Walmart (with the receipt) and return them, with the excuse of choosing the wrong size, and boom, free blades! 

While I can’t, at this time, confirm this works with Walmart, or any other store for that matter, I will make sure I do make the confirmation as soon as I have the chance.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1576935121,m1c0l3,1,1,True,2019-12-21

"ULPT: If you are late for turning in your project, send a corrupt file to the professor and buy yourself some extra time to finish it.","Corrupting files is a common trick used to bamboozle teachers/professors into believing that you actually did your work when you did not. If you are late for turning in your project, then corrupt the file, send it to the professor, and work on finishing your project. When the professor brings it up, say something along the lines of ""Yeah I turned it in... [Professor tries to open file; it doesn't work] ...hmm, I can try sending it again"" and you send in the project that hopefully you have finished by then.

**How to do it:** 

Method 1 -

1. Use a text editor such as notepad or notepad++ to open the project file (this can be any file (pptx, mp4, wav, etc...) other than a txt file)
2. Highlight some random chunks of code and delete them
3. Save the edited file
4. Send the file to your professor

Method 2 - 

1. Take any file you have that doesn't have the same extension (._ _ _ ) as your project file 
2. Change the name and extension of said file to match your project file
3. Send to professor

Example: google.exe changed to project.mp4

Note: don't use a txt file for this method (unless you are ""corrupting"" the txt file). If the professor opens the file in a text editor then it will show like a normal text file would.

Method 3 - 

1. Find a website to do the corrupting for you (https://corrupt-a-file.net/)
2. Follow instructions on website
3. Send to professor

-----

More notes:

* Don't delete too much code (first method) or replace the file with a much larger/smaller file (second method) or you'd end up having something weird like a 1kb .mp4 file that should be 5 minutes long
* After sending your corrupted file, you'd still obviously have to finish your project. 
* Corrupting files is a *very* common method used to try to get out of the consequences of turning in work late. It might work, but if you have a big class then you'll probably have several other people in the class trying the same thing.
* Because of the previous point, you may want to use this as a last resort. Because it's so common, [professors have come up with some common methods used to find out if the file had been intentionally corrupted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/5sbfys/dealing_with_the_corrupt_file_trick/?)
* If this works once, don't expect it to work multiple times. It looks suspicious the first time and the professor will definitely see something is up after a few times.

ULPT Request: How to fake an injury to avoid visiting my parents this Christmas?,"So a few months ago I booked an international flight to go see my parents this Christmas and I was actually looking forward to it. However, within the past two weeks, a series of shitstorm happened and I  would now be put in a position of extreme inconvenience if I choose to leave where I am during this period of time. I can't say much but it has a lot to do with a few time-sensitive paperwork issues and a loss of money and privileges if I leave. So now I need to come up with a legit excuse for not going home because honestly explaining the situation to my parents might result in some unsavory changes in my life as they have a lot of financial control over it. The best I came up with is to fake an accident (roads are icy, can't blame me) but in that case I'm gonna need advice on how to make it as believable as possible and to not shift the blame towards me.

"ULPT: During your year-end performance review at work, ALWAYS request clarification on departmental policies, and ask for more training.","This accomplishes a few things.

First, it gives you the appearance of wanting to be a great employee.


Second, by asking for more training, this usually results in having to do less work. Your employer may also pay to send you to training out of town, like a conference.

Third, if you are less than a model employee, by stating that policy is unclear and asking for extra training, you give yourself leverage in the event that you are disciplined or terminated. You can appeal, or even file a lawsuit, stating that the policies weren't clear and that you requested clarification, and that you even requested additional training. Even if you still get fired, it'll look like you were fired for something that wasn't your fault which looks better to a potential employer.

ULPT: How to pass a drug test for people with no soul.,"I needed to pass a mouth swab drug test for a new relatively decent paying job; only problem is that the only drug test that I’m fit to pass is literally a test to see how many drugs i can take in one sitting.

So what I did was , I Asked my grandmother to spit in a little tube a few times for an “ancestry test”

Then I cut a square corner from a sandwich bag, filled it with the aforementioned spit and sealed it shut with a lighter, creating sort of a sauce sachet filled with saliva.

I then stuffed the little sachet to the back of my mouth behind my back teeth. It was small enough to not create a bulge in my cheek and also discreet enough to still be able to talk. So I entered the office, anxiety.jpg. Played it totally cool and then pierced the bag with my teeth and soaked it in the second hand spit. 

And it worked. I passed a drug test using my grandmothers spit. I feel like I’ve dishonoured my family but man it fucking worked. 

I’m not sure if I’m a genius or a complete idiot but I got the job.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1576409209,SneakyStefan,8,1,True,2019-12-15

Buy the key with your own money (Don't worry, you'll get the money back).

4.
Get Code. (This is the most important step)

5.
Use it or give it to someone or do whatever you want with it. (Donate it didn’t extra bonus points)

6.
Open a Dispute.

7.
Escalate to the highest level and say that you did not obtain a physical material but a virtual item. You were expecting a physical item not a virtual one.

8.
Since eBay's Terms of Use clearly says that virtual items are not allowed on the market place, they will ALWAYS decide in your favor and refund you.

END
So that's how it works. If you wan't another game and you don't want for example FIFA, you can search Battlefield 4 origin key and others. Works 100%.

If this Bill is passed, our demography would be threatened.” **Manipur**: BJP Chief Minister N Biren Singh was quoted by PTI as saying Thursday that his government will not support the Bill unless a provision is included for protecting the rights of the indigenous in the Northeast. To express Manipur’s concerns, he had met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on January 12. The state is awaiting central assent for its Manipur People’s (Protection) Bill, 2018 that proposes 1951 as the cutoff for eligibility for various protections. The state Cabinet issued a note on January 10, communicated to Rajnath Singh: “There is apprehension also that once \[the Bill\] is implemented, the state could be flooded with a large number of illegal immigrants and foreigners from neighboring countries…” **Meghalaya:** On January 10, the ruling alliance, which includes two BJP MLAs, passed a resolution against the Bill. Chief Minister Conrad Sangma has termed its passage in Lok Sabha “unfortunate”. Assembly Speaker Donkupar Roy, president of BJP ally UDP, told PTI: “The Bill would open the gates for illegal immigrants from Bangladesh… We do not want the indigenous population to become a minority in our state.” **ILP States:** To enter Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland or Mizoram, Indians from other states need an inner line permit (ILP) under the provisions of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation (BEFR) Act. Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio (of BJP ally NDPP) said the state is protected but added the Bill in its present form needed review and expressed solidarity with communities who will be affected. Last May, Arunachal CM Pema Khandu (BJP) too said the state is protected by the BEFR Act 1873, while the state Congress has opposed the Bill. Mizoram CM Zoramthanga, whose MNF is part of the BJP-led alliance, told The Indian Express that his party was “very annoyed” about the passage of the Bill in Lok Sabha.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1576237550,ngaju,1,1,True,2019-12-13
"ULPT: Disagree with someone who is close to you politically? Get into arguments over it frequently? Do they think that the actions of their party are never wrong? Want to watch them squirm, stutter, and possibly get them to shut up about politics with you for a while? This elaborate ULPT is for you!","1) Research one or several things that members of *their* party have done which you haven’t argued about before. Make you’re best educated guess that they are oblivious to it. If it’s regarding a certain political figure they adamantly support, then even better. Do your research *well*. Don’t half ass it. The quality of your research will determine the quality of your satisfaction in the outcome.

2) When the time is right, bring up a new political conversation, and try to pretend your very best that your current mood is that you are rather disappointed.

3a) What separates this discussion about politics this time in particular is that you will be deliberately switching around the facts a little bit. What do I mean by this? Well, instead of it being *their* party (party Y) that was at at fault for all the horrible things you researched, you are “disappointed that **your** party (party x) did those horrible things.” Instead of the candidate that *they* support (person Y) doing all of those nasty things, it was actually “**your**candidate (person X) who did all of those nasty things.”

3b) To further clarify, if you supported Obama and they support Trump, simply just switch the names around. If you’re a republican and they are a democrat, again, switch the names around.

4)  They’ll be so excited that “you are finally seeing things their way” politically and that the two of you finally get to rip on the candidates and political party they hate together, that they won’t even see the trap they’ve just fallen into and won’t sense the plot twist coming.

5) Make sure to give them plenty of opportunities to rip on “your” party and the names of the politicians you’ve switched around. Don’t get impatient and cut it short. The harder they rip on the people/party whose names you’ve mentioned, the more glorious the outcome will be. Let them get colorful and creative. Relish the fact that they are unknowingly berating everything you know that they love and support right in front of you.

6) When the excitement they are experiencing seems to be at its peek, right when you sense it to be on the cusp of decline, this is when you strike: 

“Actually, there’s something else that I haven’t told you yet. I’ve deliberately deceived you and you fell for it. Everything you just said against person/party X is actually your true opinion about person/party Y’s actions, because it was person/party Y who did this, not X. I just got sick and tired of you disregarding horrible things like this that Y has done and you being too blinded by your support of them that you refuse to even dare criticize them about literally anything. And well, now we’ve both heard you verbally criticize your own party for once and there isn’t anything you can do about it.”


7) At this point of time a number of different things could happen. It will most likely be denial. Simply and calmly reassure them through their confusion that what you have just done is in fact what you actually did, and follow it up with something along the lines of “Honestly it feels so good to finally hear you criticize Y for once. It’s actually quite a relief.”

8) At this point of time, you’ve likely lit the fuse of a rage bomb, but remember that you’ve already achieved your victory. Them getting angry at you and trying to bait you into an explosive argument means that they are just trying to rob you of the joy of your flawlessly executed victory in light of them realizing they are the fool that they are. Don’t play along. Stay calm if they begin to retaliate with personal attacks or things you know they’ll say in attempt to get under your skin. To most successfully ensure that you will be able to remain calm and stay level-headed when this happens, simply realize in advance that this is likely what they are going to resort to, and make the decision now to not be upset with anything they say in response, later. By deciding now that you will not be upset later, you won’t be upset when the time comes, which nets you a second victory in a battle with not just them, but with yourself as well.

9) When they realize that they aren’t getting to you, that they’ve lost and there is nothing they can do about it, they’ll likely find an excuse to end the conversation. 

10) From that point forward there is at least a chance that they will leave you alone about politics for a while. If they start to bring up something about politics again, just say “Hey, remember that one time you said -this- about Y? I’ve heard all I need to know now.” Saying it with a smile and a slight chuckle will have the best effect.

11) Be cautious. Assume that it is their intention to get you to fall for the same trap you set for them from this point forward. However! If they do come to you and confide in you that since your last political conversation together they’ve realized the err of their ways, it could be genuine! After all, for the first time you’ve know them, they’ve criticized that which they never have before, and this they cannot undo! It *will* irritate them, possibly to the point where they will look up to see if what you said is actually true! But again, be cautious because it’s probably just a trap because who am I kidding? Grown adults never admit they are *wrong*, right? Part of being a really, really big, super-duper-grown-up-adult is that they are never wrong!

And there you have it, a good old switcheroo.

ULPT Request: Temporarily loser heart rate,"Hi all! Looking for a way, such as but not limited to a physical maneuver or OTC drug, to lower my heart rate enough for a few minutes, but a few hours would be ok.

I donate plasma (unpaid intern and full time student, it’s the only thing that works) and I’m perfectly healthy with an average heart rate around 60. I do consume some caffeine but otherwise my ticker is in its prime. The issue is, when I’m waiting to get my pulse taken (I see this on my watch afterward) I psych myself up that my pulse is going to be so high that... you get the idea. 

I have tried creating pressure in my chest cavity (read that might work) but I’m not sure exactly how or how close time-wise to the pulse measurement I should try that. Basically I just try to evacuate my lungs but don’t let any air out while the cuff is measuring, but if anyone has further suggestions they are welcome. 

They test BP and pulse with a cuff on the left arm, elevated from my heart on a chair that I basically have to do ab crunches to stay on, which doesn’t help. I have to stand and sit in quick succession moving through the process. 

I get these solutions don’t help my actual problem, but I do everything medically possible to manage my anxiety otherwise, so please don’t suggest meditation, therapy, and the like because I’m already doin it. Remember, I am literally fine less than 5 minutes afterward so I am not trying to provide bad plasma or panything, every other metric I test fine for. 

TLDR: I donate plasma, I am physically healthy but pulse temporarily increases beyond allowed donation threshold because of being nervous my pulse is too high.

ULPT: At my wits' end with neighbor's dog,"I’m renting an expensive studio apartment in California. A new neighbor moved right next door a month ago (we share a wall). Their dog (dog’s are allowed to live in the community) has been barking for long periods of time during the evening and has regularly woken me up multiple occasions during the early mornings. I took audio and photo evidence and notified management about it a month ago. They assured me they would contact the neighbor to work on a resolution.

The situation hasn't been resolved and management has supposedly been going through the legal process which they tell me they are unable to provide any more details about but have assured me will address the issue. That's been going on for several weeks now. In the meantime, I’ve been asked to call courtesy patrol when there is barking and I’ve done this repeatedly over the past two weeks, sometimes up to 5 times during the evening. The patrol service isn't having any success (not surprised) and are hesitant to send someone out. I've been calling still to document the issue and it's the only ""power"" I feel I have.

1. Best method but least reliable: Straight piracy finding a pdf on pirate bay or other torrent sites is just as good as an electronic copy. Anyflip is a great site to check for this

2. Most reliable but costs money: Pool for a copy. This works best when you are further into your major and are running into more specific texts that might not be easy to find. Get some of your buddies that are in the class (the more the merrier) and buy one copy together. E-copy is best because you can screen shot each page and send it to everyone as pdf (the best way to do this involves simple programming skills to auto screenshot each page and Adobe pro to combine the files) If you have to do a physical copy you just have to scan every page, If you have access to heavy duty binding equipment like a guillotine cutter you can just cut the spine off and use a feeder scanner instead of a plate scanner to save time.

3. Worst method but works in a pinch: Most university libraries have a copy of the text book for every class follow the steps for method 2 but you have to use a plate scanner. If you team up you can spread the labor around.

ULPT - Updating an outdated propane tank.,"Propane tanks are marked with a date, they can only be filled for 10 years from the date of manufacture. You can get a tank older than 10 years ""re-certified"" for use beyond that, it extends it for another 5 or 10 years, I forget which.

However, it is always less expensive to have a tank filled versus using a tank exchange location, plus at tank exchange you are getting someone else's tank every time.

So when you get a new grill and a new tank, you should get it filled instead of exchanging it, except when you have had a tank for 10 or almost 10 years, at that point you go do an exchange since you cannot legally fill it at some point in the near future. When you do the exchange, you look at the other tanks and pick one that isn't spray painted, doesn't have lots of chips in the paint and none or almost no rust.

Then check the date, which is stamped into the top part where the handle is, it is likely an almost brand new one that someone else swapped, so you can use and refill it for the next 8-10 years without needing to actually buy a new one.

Also, that tank exchange company will just take that older one and have it re-certified, since most of their tanks are re-certified in the first place.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1576089045,TinderSubThrowAway,3,1,True,2019-12-11

"Just got scammed out of $600 on eBay, what can I do in revenge?","Essentially, I sold a laptop for $600. The buyer had a valid address and everything. Then I got an email from somebody who clearly created an account with the exact same username with a 1 added at the end. He told me to change the shipping address, so I did.

It was only when the actual buyer told me the item arrived in the wrong state. The address I sent it to is commonly used as a scam location (8 McCullough Dr,  New Castle, DE). The address is not a home, but rather, a business. Obviously eBay can do nothing about it since it was a separate account. There will be no way to be refunded for this mistake, and the blame falls on me for not being thorough.

However, I was scammed nonetheless. I am wondering what would be a solid retaliation. I am considering sending a box of human shit to the address with no return address, but even that seems too underwhelming . What can I do that won’t cost a ton of money, but will get a very obvious message across.

I have learned my lesson on thoroughness, so no need to explain that to me. I take fault, but still wouldn’t mind the sweet taste of “fuck you.”

The process is somewhat complex if you've never done anything like it before, but I just wanted to show people that it's possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer:

This may take you around 1 day of research if you actually want to attempt it, and if you screw something up very badly, you may lose the data stored on your phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview:

\-basically you access the root directory on your phone without actually being rooted, and copy a file where all the passwords are stored to a directory that you can freely access, then read it with a text editor and find the passwords you are looking for

&amp;#x200B;

Requirements:

\-this will only work on android, and not Huawei, Samsung, or Acer devices (as far as I know)",UnethicalLifeProTips,1576014855,bobTheCabbage334,1,1,True,2019-12-10

ULPT For Businesses who sell your phone number to robocallers.,"Start with a new phone number.  Only disclose the phone number to one company each 60 days.  When you get a robocall ""Update"" your contact phone number with the most recent company that you have given your phone number to.

ULPT Use Google Voice to get cheap shit on Craigslist,"90% of the time people selling on Craigslist want to sell *fast* and need cash *now*.  But they don't want to feel ripped off.  So give them a super duper mega low ball, and then just a regular lowball.  Put the power in your hands, and *make* them feel like they are getting the better side of the deal. 



Step 1: create a Google voice account.  It's free.  It gives you a phone # connected to your Google account. You can call and text with it. 

Step 2: find what you want on Craigslist

Step 3: text the # on the Craigslist ad lowballing the shit out if them.  use this to gauge their response.  most stuff sits forever on Craigslist and buyers are often flaky, or just flat out retarded.  say theres a car up for $5k.  Offer them $2.5k with your Google voice account phone #. If they say yes then buy it, but likely they will say no.  Ask a lot of questions. Be interested, and reply quickly

Step 4: wait a couple minutes, and then text them with your real phone #.  offter them a little more, but not much.  so offer like $2.8-$3k for that car you just ""offered"" $2.5k with your Google voice phone #

Step 5: buyer will weigh his options, and choose the ""higher"" option, even though the 2 offers are coming from the same person (you) and one is super shitty, while the other is only slightly less shitty.  He's gonna take the higher offer, so offer what you want with your real #, and go 20-30% lower than that with your Google voice phone #


I've used this to get a car, a DJI drone, woodworking tools, a snowboard, and a camera.  

Every time you make the seller feel like your offer is reasonable, even though you're still lowballing them....you're offering more than the ""other guy"" aka you on your Google voice phone #",UnethicalLifeProTips,1575686765,coco4shade,13,1,True,2019-12-06

ULPT: Use your leftover scholarship/grant money on WHATEVER you want.,"I'm in college for my second degree. Due to financial circumstances and medical circumstances before college, I qualified (and still qualify) for a long list of grants and scholarships. The first time I pursued a degree, everything was covered. Same with this time. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of scholarships and grants. The best part? I use it on whatever I want because of the significant amount that's leftover. I'm a disabled student with medical conditions, who's on disability, section 8 housing, LIHEAP, and food stamps. You may think that my leftover grant and scholarship money just rolls over to the next semester. It doesn't.

Instead, I get a refund through my school account (which can be used as a credit/debit card with my school account card to make purchases or withdrawal cash from ATMs). Then the process starts all over again during the next semester. My grants (and even some of my scholarships) are renewable. At the same time, there's always thousands of excess leftover on my account each semester. I've already bought a car, gone out to eat at many restaurants, moved into a better apartment, traveled (plane tickets) and also saved some of the money.

If you're in college, apply for every grant and scholarship you can find in which you meet requirements for. After rewarded, whatever is leftover after each semester charge will go to your account as a leftover refundable balance. You can do whatever you want with it. Enjoy! I called the social security office and asked if college, grants, or scholarships affect disability benefits or any other benefits. They said no.

TL;DR They're probably assuming all scholarship/grant money gets used up each semester (aren't aware of the debit, credit, cash refunds). But hey, they didn't ask for the details so... And in all the years of doing this (at three different schools, mind you) I've never ever gotten in trouble for this. Theoretically, I am paying for room, board, food, and transportation.

Officer is getting irate. ""You what?""

""She's in the trunk if you want to see.""

The Officer slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.

The senior officer, ""Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!""

The Driver steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

""One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.""

""Murdered the owner?""

The officer:, ""Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car please?""

The Driver  opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.

The officer:, ""Is this your car sir?""

The Driver : ""Yes"" &amp; hands over the registration papers.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.""

The Driver digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner.""

They'll tow your car immediately up to 5 miles and you still get another 3 tows for free for the next 365 days. At least in my town tows cost about $90 each even if it's just a half mile tow which I've had happen to me. I'd imagine in large cities it's even more expensive. 

If you're vehicle is far from home or a shop you can sign up for the next tier of AAA and get up to 100 mile tows but the price is about double. Another possible negative is that I'd have to imagine using AAA takes longer to get an actual tow than simply calling a tow service. Since AAA afaik is basically acting as the middleman to get your tow.

ULPT REQUEST: How to get someone in trouble for handling/disturbing baby sea turtle hatchlings (which is horrible for their survival) and posting about it on social media?,"To keep it brief, I’ll spare details. There’s a girl. She has personally wronged and many others me multiple times and is generally just a shitty selfish person. Anyway, she recently took a trip to Mexico and posted about it multiple times on several social media sites.

She went full “Instagram influencer” and posted several pictures of her picking up, holding, and taking pictures with numerous baby sea turtle hatchlings. If you’re unaware, this drastically decreases their chances of survival and always messes up the hatchlings’ imprinting process. So, handling them ensures that the hatchlings will not know to return to the beach to lay eggs. Sea turtles are already very endangered, and because handling the hatchlings is so dangerous for them, there are multiple laws and fines/repercussions for doing so. For that reason, all beaches with hatchlings have multiple signs saying to not touch them. There is no way anyone there could possibly think it’s okay to mess them. But does this girl give a shit? Hell no, she wants those Instagram likes. Fuck the turtles.

Is there any way I could get her in trouble for this? She has provided lots of proof, which I screenshotted, but it all took place in Mexico, not the US where I’m from (although I do know it’s still illegal to touch hatchlings on US beaches). And the state I live in does have beaches with sea turtles, so I know there’s an enforceable law in place, I just don’t know if I can take action because the actual “crime” happened in Mexico. 

Thanks for any feedback! And if you ever see something cool in nature, enjoy it, take picture, but please please don’t be the selfish asshole that kills baby sea turtles for Instagram likes.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1575424848,pettyrevturtle,0,1,True,2019-12-03

ULPT Request: How do I lie to my employer because I don't want to miss the upcoming solar eclipse?,"I know this sounds silly, but I really need some advice.

I have been looking forward to the 26 Dec 2019 solar eclipse. From the south-western coastal area of India, the ""ring of fire"" will be visible. This area is only a night's travel from my home.

However, because of work, I have to go to Delhi, which is in the northern part of the country. I might leave some time next week and return in January.

For the eclipse, I can obviously fly from Delhi to the costal area, witness the eclipse, and fly back. But this will involve a lot of travel and cost me money, at least 10, 000 Rs. (~140 USD).

In addition, there are a bunch of other projects that will take me to Delhi in January. For these projects, I'll be in Delhi for at least 2 months. During this time, on my day off, I can do a lot of sight seeing.

So, how do I lie to my employer that I cannot travel now.

Here are two things, I can lie about:

I. Dad: He has retired, and has plans to go back to his village and start farming. I can tell my boss that there is a lot of work related to this, and my dad ""really needs my help""  during the weekend.

II. Health: Few months ago, I got diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Even though my vitamin B12 is ok, I'm experiencing some symptoms like numbness around my waist. I have been taking medication for both. It has been gradually getting better.

I can tell my employer that my deficiency got ""worse"". Therefore, my doctor put me on new medication, and wants me to get my blood work done every two weeks to monitor my progress.

Due to these two reasons, it will be ""very difficult"" for me to travel.

Did anyone find these lies plausible? I suck at lying, people see right through it. So, please help me tell a convincing lie.

Sign up for a free credit card service like revolut and you can use disposable virtual credit cards.

I do it for every online transaction. Not only is it safe, but when I subscribe to a free trial, i just fill in the disposable credit card info, submit the application and delete the card. Then I don't need to worry anymore about canceling the subscription!

**Unlimited Trials**
Here's how to get new trials over and over again: 
If you need to use a different email each time just add +1 to your email. So example@outlook.com becomes example+1@outlook.com. This gets seen as a new email by the website but the mails wil still come to your example@outlook.com mail. Then use above mentioned service or a similar one to generate a new disposable credit card each time to go with the new account you're creating for another free trial!


**Escape cancelation fees**
I had a subscription to the Adobe suite and canceling would cost me 200 dollar (the remainder of my years subscription) went in to my account, changed my payment details to a disposable credit card, confirmd the card, deleted the card and canceled my subscription. Apply this where possible to your subscriptions!

Now Adobe can't charge me the cancelation fee because the card they have on record doesn't exist anymore 💪🏼

"ULPT: Any land owned by a town/city, county, or state is open to the public unless otherwise posted.","Except where posted (no trespassing, only open during certain hours, or fenced in, etc.), government owned land is open to the public. Towns/cities, counties, and states typically own more empty property than you'd expect. This land can be used by citizens for things like cookouts/picnics, hunting, etc. Anyone living nearby full probably assume you own the property, and cops can't keep up with ALL of the property their government owns so they are less likely to investigate people out in a vacant field if they're minding their own business. It can also be used to cultivate certain (possibly illegal) crops; and since the land belongs to the government, the cops would have to work REALLY hard to find any evidence.

Government owned land can be found in your state by finding the state's geographic information system website, or for the county appraisers. This information is public record.

Like I said previously, cops aren't likely to bother you as long as you aren't doing anything suspicious or obviously illegal. However, they may ask you to leave. You don't necessarily have a right to be there, it's more of a privilege.

If you can figure out a way to occupy this land long enough, you can claim it for yourself. You have to be able to prove that you've been living there as your primary residence, in most cases for several years before you can make this claim, but this has been done. This is ""squatters rights"" and varies wildly from state to state.

The government may own the land due to the previous owner not paying taxes, a government buyout due to recurring flooding, the land had previously been used for something but not anymore and the land never got sold, or for a planned purpose in the future.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1575364238,krzysztofgetthewings,0,1,True,2019-12-03

ULPT REQUEST: How do I get out of trouble with retail asset protection?,"I work at a retail store and got caught with a somewhat minor, explainable thing. Through intimidation tactics, they were able to get me to admit stealing multiple items from many months ago. As they tend to do, they got in my head and acted like they knew things they clearly didn’t. As they were writing up the statement, I realized that they actually didn’t know anything for sure or have evidence of me stealing and that they were just intimidating me and hoping that I incriminated myself, which I did. After they printed out the statement, I read it and saw that they stated the damage towards the company was more than $1k. They have absolutely no evidence of me stealing items from 5-6 months ago. I was more confident that they’re full of shit, so I requested that they change my statement and I told them I didn’t actually steal the items, but they said they wouldn’t do it. So I DID NOT sign the statement and they wrote Refused to Sign on the top, and I wrote my own lengthy statement on the next page saying that I didn’t steal anything. Right after that, they gave me a notice of suspension, stating that I have 48 hours to call the support line and explain my story or else they would consider it my forced resignation. I signed the suspension notice and went home, I’ll call the support line tomorrow. How can I best bullshit this situation to get out of it and make sure that it doesn’t get the cops involved?

"ULPT: Carry a police radio scanner in your car, it can come handy","Hey everyone. My friend is a police dispatcher and he wanted to share some tips with us because his boss is a dick. Pretty much every police department uses radios to communicate, and not many agencies use encrypted systems.

**""How do I get set up?""**

If you live in a somewhat large city, chances are there might be a live feed of your area's radio traffic already being streamed. In that case, all you need is an app on your phone.

If a live stream isn't available, you can get a radio scanner for about $150 (for an analog system) to $300 (for newer digital systems). Not sure which one you need? Go to [Radio Reference](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/) and put your zip code in the search box. It will give you a list of all the public safety channels in your area. Click on the name of the agency, and look under ""Mode"". If it has ""A"" it's analog, ""D"" is digital, and ""M"" is mixed (use a digital scanner). If you see the letter ""E"", that means that channel is encrypted and a scanner won't work (see below for a workaround). A digital radio can also usually pick up analog signals as well. There are programming guides online, but many new scanners are plug and play: you just punch in your zip code and it programs itself. 

**""So what can I do with a scanner?""**

Lots of things, ranging from harmless to borderline-illegal:

* Listen out for traffic accidents or checkpoints and navigate around them.

* Set your radio in ""close call"" mode and it will chirp at any strong signals nearby. That means there's generally a cop, paramedic, or firefighter nearby.

* Get the scoop on what's going on in the neighborhood.

* Use it when committing a crime. You can hear the police get dispatched, so you know when it's time to leave. You can also hear if they're going to a call on the other side of town, so use that to your advantage.

**""I hear them talking, but I can't understand them. What do I do?""**

If it's just them talking too fast, you'll get used to it. Trust me. It's easy to develop a ""radio ear"" in as little as a few hours of listening.

Many departments use ""10-codes"" which are used to shorten messages and provide some (very weak) security. Many of you already know a few, such as 10-4 for ""understood"". 10-4 is the only universal 10-code, but there are some semi-standardized lists you can find [here](http://copradar.com/tencodes/index.html). If those codes aren't the same ones used near you, look up 10 codes for the closest large city or state police department, they tend to be similar to local 10-codes.

You don't even *need* to know what the 10-codes are for certain crimes. When a call is dispatched, the address is almost always given in an uncoded format. For example, we might say:

&gt; All units, 10-35 in progress at 123 Main Street. Responding units acknowledge.

So if you're breaking into the house at 123 Main Street, you don't need to know that a 10-35 is a burglary, you just know that the cops are on their way and it's time to get out of there. Also listen for alert tones (such as a long, steady beep or a ""wee-woo"" warble tone) that often indicate a serious crime in progress.

If you hear static or can't understand much at all, you might need a good antenna. Amazon sells a decent car roof antenna for about $15 and it's well worth it. Range depends on the antenna you get and the system they're using, but for me is generally about 20 miles from the nearest repeater.

**My local department encrypts their radio channels. What can I do?""**

An encrypted system isn't the end of the world. If you plan on using a radio for... less than legal reasons, then it's easy to steal one. Call the cops for a routine theft report or something, and have someone else steal the handheld radio from the car. Dispatch can remotely deactivate a radio, but we very rarely do unless you transmit on it and disrupt our operations. The NYPD has been having issues with stolen radios and they don't even encrypt most of their channels.

**Anything I should be careful about?**

Yes:

* A few states (such as Florida and New York) prohibit the use of a scanner in a vehicle, unless you're a licensed amateur radio operator (which is an easy license to get).

* Using a scanner during a crime can get you extra charges, depending on where you live.

* Dispatch has no way of knowing if you're using a scanner, but officers will often let us know if there are scanners located at an address so we can update our records.

* There are other ways for officers and dispatch to communicate. They will often relay sensitive information (such as a criminal history) via phone or an instant messenger system.

**TL;DR** Get a police radio scanner. They have many uses if you want to hear what the cops are doing.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1574997551,Vini_Dalvino,24,1,True,2019-11-28

ULPT: How To Cheat On A Math Test,"**Do not try this unless there is no other way of passing the class.** 

What you will need: 

1. A smart phone with access to the internet
2. A calculator with a calculator case  


  


On the day of the test, arrive 15 minutes early so you can sit near the back.

Now get out your calculator place it on the desk so that the teacher can see it. When you know that the teacher has glanced at you and seen you with a calculator, you're good to go.  Now take your calculator off of the case and put your smart-phone in the calculator case instead. That way, the teacher will think you're using a calculator when you're actually discreetly using your phone to look up the answers. 

On the test, type in the equation on [mathway.com](https://mathway.com) and when it gives you the answer, put that on your test. It's better to do this early when plenty of people are still in the room, as less people means that more attention will be focused on you and this is never good if you're trying to cheat.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1574917900,YeetroyJenkins,3,1,True,2019-11-28

ULPT Dear Virgins,"Are you tired of being Single? Afraid of the thought that your future girlfriend has been touched by so many chads?

Then I´ve got the perfect plan for you!

Remember that german singer Michael Wendler? That guy did it right and you can too!

All you need is time and good taste (you virgins probably won't care anyway), because listen carefully, we are going to groom our ideal partner.

Step one would be to look out for good looking people with little children that have inherited as many of their good genes as possible.

Step two: befriend those fresh parents and just be with them, if need be just fake the friendship because all you really need is their offspring (now I know this sounds super weird but you are not interested in the child, you are interested in the 18 years old version of it). 
During the growuptime is important to create a close relationship with the soon to be partner, but be careful that the relationship does not develop into a too strong friendship, you could end up in a friendzone and all that time would be for nothing.

Step three: the child is no longer a child, finally it's old enough to be in a relationship with you.

Step four: profit of your virgin perfectly groomed new girlfriend/boyfriend

ULPT: Intelligent Speeding. Speed at the lowest MPH or KM/H required for your situation.,"When you’re running late and inevitably need to speed, you can mitigate the risk of receiving a hefty ticket by practicing intelligent speeding. The idea is counter-intuitive—speed as slow as possible—but it actually makes a lot of sense. I’ll do my best to hash it out. 

There are often situations that will slow you down while speeding (e.g., another car driving the speed limit on a single lane road) or bring you to a screeching halt (e.g. a red light). Accurately assessing these annoying circumstances is the key to “intelligent speeding.” Let’s take the example of a different car driving the speed limit (30mph) on a single lane road. If the car is about 100 meters away from you, then there is little sense in speeding at 65mph, only to be halted by there leisurely travel. Risking a ticket for 35mph over the speed limit is silly when you’re going to be slowed by grandma in her Oldsmobile. Instead, choose a slower speed that will still enable you to catch grandma (e.g., 45mph) and prepare for your next move to open up. This principle can be applied in numerous situations and mitigates the risk of receiving a ticket.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1574882403,sips_beer,12,1,True,2019-11-27

ULPT: Making a lot of cash quickly with r/fashionreps,"Hello! Today i present to you the scummiest and most unethical thing you can do with Reddit!

For any hype beasts out there, we all know that brands such as Gucci, Off-White, Supreme, Palace, Anti Social Social Club are quite expensive brands. As of last year, my buddy showed me a subreddit called r/FashionReps where you can essentially purchase replica items for CHEAP CHEAP.

Ex. The average Off-White Sweater such as  [https://www.off---white.com/en/CA/men/products/omki012s20i010121060#](https://www.off---white.com/en/CA/men/products/omki012s20i010121060#)goes for around 2K CAN Dollars. On TaoBao, it averages at around 50-100 CAN Dollars.

The Tip: Purchase items as listed on r/fashionreps and sell it off in your hometown as the ""real"" thing. Assuming there are people who are desperate enough and doesnt know the difference, you can easily sell items and turn a 600% profit per sweater depending on what you want to sell. Its not just clothing tho! There are plenty of accessories and toys you can sell off as well! Its important to note you can also purchase the replica receipts for less than 10 cents.

Beware tho. There are harsh penalties for selling replicas but agencies such as Kijiji or Ebay would assist you in making a quick transaction.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1574425591,Deleriousmexican,4,1,True,2019-11-22

ULPT REQUEST: Claiming against FedEx,"I “didn’t receive” a package for clothing 9 months ago. It was worth a little over $500 and was delivered by FedEx. No signature confirmation.

I talk to FedEx today for two hours, via Live Chat and phone, trying to get a follow up on my case and all the representatives just seem so clueless.

Returning reimbursed phone for refund after leaving company,"Not sure if this is an unethical tip, or more a tip on how to be ethical, presented to experts in the unethical :) 

My company offers a $500 smartphone reimbursement to its employees. The reimbursement is a one-time use, and presumably, is meant to allow employees to access work related emails, although no explicit motive or goal is stated by the company. Once purchased, the phone becomes personal property, and we can use it for whatever we want.

My question is - what are the ethics of buying a phone and returning it back to the store to keep the cash? In the benefits document that outlines the policy, no mention is made of what the phone must be used for, or what the reimbursement policy is intended for. Given that it is my personal property, why would it be any different from selling it as a used phone a year later?

ULPT: *EXTRA* Free Annual Credit Report Without Any Security Checks.,"Preface (ULPT at the bottom):

This ULPT came about from making a complaint.

I had issues with account creation at the credit reporting agencies due to them not following the RFC standard/guidance for allowable email address characters (and other issues).

You may already know you can get a free credit report either in digital or hard form via each of the 3 credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) each year. Just cycle around the 3 agencies over 3 years.

For me, it began with one of the agencies not accepting my \*correct\* answers to the security questions, so I couldn't get the digital copy. Calling made no difference.

Fine, I just went with a different agency and got it. Then I made a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) and surprisingly got an unwanted hard copy sent to me in the mail from the original agency. According to them, I failed the security checks (wrong). But later on, I'll find out it came to me because of the complaint where \*NO\* security checks were done.

Then later this year I had to unfreeze my credit report for something. Again, I encounter issues with their site(s) and I make another complaint when customer support was useless.

Again, this instance was about UNFREEZING my report. I had NO interest in another credit report being sent to me.

annualcreditreport (.com) -&gt; ""Contact Us"" -&gt; ""Continue to contact form"" -&gt; ""Other"" -&gt; (check off whatever agencies) -&gt; other -&gt; Description.

This is what I did. You may only need to select one of the other options where you don't have to put in any information (description).

I think my complaint for that second time was about the web site and the useless support, or no way to contact a human.

Again, I'll emphasize that I did NOT want my credit report sent to me, just for them to fix their problems... but both agencies I selected sent me my credit report. Again, no security checks were done, and this is now 2 credit reports from 1 agency received in 1 year.

I'm flummoxed why I was getting these credit reports sent to me and calling support was again like pulling teeth trying to get an explanation. At least that one agency had a different contact phone number on the report that did let me speak to a human.

I finally made one last complaint that was also a test. I selected those agencies again, and explicitly stated that I did NOT want to receive any ""complementary"" credit report sent to me.

You can probably guess that I DID receive another credit report, but only from one of the agencies (so far). That makes it 3 hard copies from that 1 agency in 1 year.

I have no interest in hard copies. I only want the digital form. Being one who cares about the environment, it pains me. Then add on the fact that there is no security involved in getting the credit report shows that nothing was learned from 2017.

This is our society folks, enjoying the ride so far? It's only going to get worse.

ULPT Request Trying to finesse a new MacBook Pro using their repair policy.,"So I’ve done this one before and want to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. 

In 2012 I got a new MBP. But the display went out in 2014. It was a known issue with the model but they offered to change the logic board for like $500. 

Cool it worked but after about a month, the issue came back again. They told me that either I could pay for another repair, or they could just give me a new computer, since it was a known issue. I said sure I’ll take a new computer and they ended up giving me a computer worth like $2500! 

My original computer was like $1500 and the money I paid for the repair was $500 so it was basically full profit! 

Now my 2015 MBP is having display issues (different display problem than last time) and it’s not a severe but they said that it could again be a logic board issues. They are offering to change in for $575. 

However what if I get that done, and then go back a month later again  and say that the issue is still there lolol. Do u think they would offer me another computer again?

ULPT request: How do I haunt a house?,"Hey all, TLDR at end of post.
2 friends and I (males) are renting the top half of a house, above 2 girls who live downstairs. Their lease agreement is nearing renewal and we really want to get one of the girls kicked out. An unbearable human being. Unfortunately she has yet to break any lease rules so we cannot complain to our landlord about her. Her roommate also wants to get rid of her, and she is also willing to stoop to moral lows to get her out. The catch? she is dating one of my friends who lives upstairs with me. So, she comes upstairs constantly and is quite disruptive, but her boyfriend (my roommate) wouldn't let us kick her out or dispute with the landlord. My other friend, and the other girl living downstairs all want the girl in question to leave with no technical wrongdoings. What do we do? We laughed over ideas of making her think the house is haunted, but upon further interest we decided it's just about the only option we have. Short of framing her for noise complaints/disturbances, which we do not want to do because the landlord is partial towards her, what do I do reddit?
TLDR: Shitty downstairs tenant needs to go, how do I make her leave without breaking the law?

ULPT Get free booze / aftershave off Amazon,"This one has probably been done to death but hey, never hurts to repeat it.

Order a bottle of spirits / champagne etc, heck even a couple of bottles then contact customer services after it's been ordered and tell them the bottle has leaked / is smashed.

Don't need to explain further. 

If they ask for evidence you just tell them you've already chucked it away as it was leaking / was dangerous with the glass shards.

Same rule applies of course to aftershave. 

They will offer you the choice of a refund or replacement. Up to you what you fancy.

Source: I work for the company and have done their customer service training.

Also, most items below around $10 it's cheaper for them to send a replacement without getting you to also send back the 'defect' item, so do go ahead and do that as well.

This will work on all accounts, but don't over-do it. Go for a couple of bottles in the first hit, then after some regular orders, go for a 2-for-1 cheapie product on the second method.

Beware that their software can quickly pull up all accounts with your zip or postal code, so if you're doing it multiple times use different addresses (work, partner, sibling etc) and different payments types.

ULPT: Get free Christmas gifts from Reddit. No kids required. But kids mean more. Also tips to get more gifts.,"**Step One: Register to get free stuff**

Go to r/SantasLittleHelpers and go through their registration process. No karma requirement, no proof of need, just register. Make an amazon wishlist for yourself and make up some kids. If you have less than 4 people, you don't need a photo to prove how many people there are. If you're feeling like you want a big fake family, just find a photo on someone's facebook or insta and use it.

There is no requirement that you are low income or anything. You just have to believe in the Santas of Reddit. Limit is $100 per kid and $25 per adult. So you can get whatever you really want if you make up a big enough family. 

**Step Two: Make Amazon List**

Pick items you kind of want, or would be appropriate for your fake kids. You can always return them for gift cards to Amazon later. 

Be sure to leave the ""dream gifts"" on there, too. Sometimes a Santa will just buy out the whole list. If anyone questions an item on your list, be sure to say your autistic child you're homeschooling always plays on Amazon and it was a mistake.

Do not turn off the ""bought elsewhere option."" There are reminders and mod notes in the sub to do this. Don't. This is important for Step Four.

Be sure to make all purchases hidden, too. That way when Santas click on your wishlist, they can't see what has been bought. It will look like your kids have nothing. So, they will buy more.

**Step Three: Make Post**

You're going to need to appeal to the Reddit community. The ones that get the most attention are ""my kid is autistic and must have this exact game/game system/toy."" Throw in some sob stories about domestic violence, daddy in jail, or made up mental illnesses. Those go a long way for getting stuff. So does saying you're a student, single parent, stay at home mom, or that you homeschool your kids. Car accidents, fires, floods...these all go a long way, too.

Be sure to say ""be blessed"" or that you will pay it forward. You don't have to. That's just what people do. Oh, and be sure that one of your kids says that you need to post your wishlist because you are the bestest mommy. 

**Step Four: If no one buys stuff for you, wait a few days and claim to get Grinched.**

""Grinching"" means that your wishlist is marked complete on Amazon but nothing has been bought. You may have to have a friend go in and mark your list ""bought elsewhere"" as proof to the mods. This will allow you to post again, saying your kids are devastated because they thought there would be a Christmas and now there isn't any.

So, TL;DR: r/SantasLittleHelpers gives away free gifts. If you're an unethical dude, you can get more stuff. You can also return gifts for Amazon gift cards and DNA a bunch of these gifts.

ULPT REQUEST: Taking personal amounts of drugs with you on vacation through an airport on a domestic flight.,"Ive heard conflicting things. Some say its easy and not even something to worry about, some say its difficult and not worth the risk.

Apparently the TSA isn't looking for drugs they are looking for weapons. Still though, bringing a few grams of coke looks like sketchy loose powder that would catch their eye. Maybe be seen as a weapon anyway.

Is it easier to being on your carry on or is it better to put in your checked in luggage? In checked in luggage id be worried about dogs or a more intensive search because they aren't in a rush like they are in carry on line.

Should you take the powder out of your bag and put it in a travel sized baby powder bottle? Does that make it even sketchier? What about taking the tiny gram bags and just leaving them in a pants pocket in your checked in luggage? 

Ive also heard you can find out the address to where you are staying and mail yourself the shit. In that case im worried about the drugs being noticed in the mail and confiscated and me ending up arrested. What's the best way to go about mailing it?

ULPT Request: Lying about Bachelor’s Degree to get a job,"Before I receive the invariable flood of “its not worth it” and “its risky”- yes, I understand the risk of being discovered and all associated risks. 

I have been unemployed since May. I live in a metropolitan area where it seems you need a degree to be considered for even the entry-levelest jobs around.  I am currently enrolled in school and earning my degree; nonetheless, I am finding it next-to-impossible to even snag an interview. 

I have a decent resume in terms of experience, so I’m confident that it isn’t so much my experience getting in my way as much as my lack of degree. 

I am flirting with the idea of just saying I earned a Bachelor’s degree on my resume in order to qualify for administrative, account management, order fulfillment, etc. jobs. Nothing requiring any technical education or anything that would create any serious liability with respect to lying about being qualified. I just  want a job that requires you to know your way around microsoft office and customer service practices, essentially.

Student loans are tricky, but if you don't have a Federal Loan, or you just f'd up and put to much shit on credit after school and your F'd, there is hope!

Contrary to what many of us feel, there is no Debtors Prison in America. Meaning, you can not go to jail or have any charges brought against you for not paying back a loan.

All you have to do is go work in another country for 7 years, and make less than about 100K USD converted which will make sure you don't owe the USA any Tax money.

When you return to the USA you will have no credit, the debts will be gone. And if you worked in a country with a currency greater than the USD, then you may even bring BONUS BUCKS back to the states!!

First you wanna head over to: https://www.chipotle...contact-us.html
Scroll down and click the section of ""Report an Issue."" Click on ""Tell us about it.""
It will redirect you to a small page with a question. Choose ""an order"" &gt; ""in a Chipotle"" &gt; Food was cold 
 
(You can choose problems about the staff, but I personally don't because sometimes it can get people fired/fuck with people's job.)
 
Make sure you tick ""Yes, please contact me"" and use a Chipotle location that is NEAR you. 
 
In the ""Anything else you'd like to know?"" section, write something like this:
 
(This is literally a copy and paste from what I did earlier.) 
""My boyfriend and I were eating at this location yesterday, on the 10th at about 2:30 PM. We both purchased burrito bowls. We successfully purchased our food with no problems, but when we sat down to eat the food, the rice was cold and stale - it was very dried out, and it made the entire meal unpleasant. However, the other parts such as the meat and beans were warm. With the ruined rice, we barely finished our food and went to eat somewhere else for lunch. I'm very disappointed with this dining experience. We definitely won't be back.""
 
DO NOT COPY THIS. Be creative, change up some stuff. Make yourself seem very disappointed.
 
Maybe change it up saying that you were wtih friends/family/etc. Typically if you say that you were alone they'll give you a free meal for one person, but if you say that you were with your bf/gf they'll give you free meal for 2, etc etc.
 
After that, you don't need to attach a receipt or anything of the like. Hit continue. 
 
Choose a date that was reasonably recent, at max a month ago. The time, make it anything. But be reasonable. Be sure that you're consistent with your text from before. 
 
Fill out your contact information correctly, with real information so that you can properly be reached.
 
Submit and wait for a response. 
 
Chipotle responds really fast; when I made my ticket earlier they responded in less than a couple hours. 
 
They'll respond with something like this:
 
(Copying the response that I got).
 
Hi &lt;NAME&gt;,

ULPT How to effectively pose as a veteran on veterans day,"1) Find a DD-214 online. This the discharge form used to tell whether a veteran is legit. Fill it out convincingly. Also look for a benefits card. They're a bit harder to find but it helps.

2) Never say or anything too incredible. People often become suspicious If you claim to be a war hero. Also stay away from professions that deal with specific technology like mechanics. 

3) Pretend to be something low-key that every base needs like a cook or an analyst. Then learn the MOS or job code for it

4) Get to know some basic Regulations and facts about the military. 

-AR 670-1: Dress and appearance for the Army

-AFI 36-2903: Dress and appearance for the Air Force

-The UCMJ: uniform code of military Justice AKA military law.

5) NEVER purchase or wear a uniform. This makes it all too easy to snuff out fakes. Any veteran will just show their DD-214

6) NEVER claim to be high-ranked. Always claim to have gotten out as an E-4. This is the most common pay grade to get out at

E-4's go by different names per branch here's a list: 
specialist in the Army, 
corporal in the Marine Corps, 
senior airman in the Air Force, 
petty officer third class in the Navy.

ULPT Request: scare my roommates into locking the doors,"Background info: my roommates are adamant about keeping the door unlocked at all times. It’s been 2 years. I have argued, hired a locksmith, put out a spare key, argued, cried, and everything in between but they adamantly refuse. In today’s installment of please-I-don’t-feel-safe-we-live-downtown-in-a-city my roommate claimed it’s her culture to not lock doors. She’s white and from a town of less than 1,000 people. Apparently this is “culture.” I digress, I have all but given up hope.  My lease isn’t up until June at which point I am definitely moving out and my landlord is an insane person who agrees with my roommates. (He refused to give us keys so I had to hire someone out of my own pocket.) They don’t carry a key on them but they know about the spare so when I lock the doors, the doors are immediately unlocked as soon as one of them notices. I want to give them a good scare to errr persuade them to be a little more safety conscious. I already had to two ideas but they sucked because of various reasons.

Idea 1) take away the spare and lock them out.

Why it sucks: that will just make them want the doors unlocked even MORE.

Idea 2) have a friend they don’t know put on a ski mask and walk in one night while they’re home and pretend to be burgling the place.

Why it sucks: what if they tackle him and call the police. He could actually go to jail. What’s his alibi? His friend who lives there said to do it?

ULPT: Use your coworkers to get a threat out without making the threat directly,"This is a piggy back off [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/dtuy3c/lpt_never_tell_a_coworker_anything_you_wouldnt/) Life Pro Tip. I figured instead of complaining that people gossip and that you can't be real with your coworkers - use it to your advantage. 

Best to use this tactic to buy time/breathing room to find a new job:

**Situation**: Your manager is making your life hell. Maybe you have enough for a legal harassment charge or hostile workplace or discrimination or all of the above. Maybe you don't. 

**Task**: Get your manager to back off without making a direct threat which usually just exacerbates things and gets HR directly involved. 

**Action**: Take the coworker on your level that is the most likely to snitch on you or the closest to your manager to lunch (don't pay for lunch or else it may be suspicious). Vent about all the poor things your manager is doing. Ask for advice. Thank them for that advice. Then mention how you already have a solution. Wait for them to ask. Then tell them you already lawyered up and just need to collect a few more incidences to build a case. 

**Resolution**: Your manager's back will never be straighter around you because she knows you already have a lot of ammo (or you don't and you psyched her into believing you have ammo). 

**Reflection:** This could backfire with a truly aggressive/stupid manager. Fantastic. So let's hope to you having real ammo, actual lawyers and the easy opportunity to collect more from a willing manager. Doubtful. 

Alternative Manager Response #1 - Get HR Involved based on Hearsay

Deny it. If they go so far as to bring the person you had lunch with, you can make sure that person goes down as an office gossip/snitch. BUT use the opportunity to tell HR (KEY - send them an email in writing after the meeting as a recap) that you think X manager is discriminating against you for a trait you have no control over (vague wording points to sex, religion, race, etc - basically Federally protected classes). You have had conversations about this with your manager, but the hostile behavior does not seem to change. 

Use the manager's paranoia to go to HR in the first place against s/he  

Result? You buy even more time to look for a new job, they give you a new manager, or turn the tables on your manager internally under the guise that s/he went to HR first and not you (important. Some folks still think you're a snitch if you go to them first) by getting them fired or relocated. 

Depending on how you play it - nothing happens to your manager and you look like a litigious hot button or you win the war with your manager. Keeping emails and conversation logs are key. 

Alternative Manager Response #2: Fully Flaccid 

Or it could cause them to not attack you anymore (desired result) but give you shit projects/ignore you by engaging as little as possible. This gives you space. But you may have to look elsewhere for work within the company (unless your manager trashed your rep behind your back) or outside of it. 

Best to use this tactic to buy time/breathing room to find a new job. The company will probably give you your last two weeks on PTO (assuming you are going to work for a competitor) just to make sure that you don't come back with a lawsuit if they dishonorably walk you out w/o working the last two weeks.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1573361487,PopularTradition,3,1,True,2019-11-09

Get caught lying about little things, like eating the last [food item] or something. When you get caught, lie like a deer in a street lamp, be unconvincing and unconfident. After doing this a few times, you are seen as a bad liar. 
Another thing you can do is to laugh when it’s brought up, as in a laugh that you know something but don’t want to say it. Just act suspicious when asked basically so you get caught in the lie.

Now when you actually need to lie, just go for it, straight face, confident voice, no stammering and a convincing but not overly though our seeming story.

People thing you are bad at hiding stuff, so the stuff you do hide is hidden better.

Personally this works wonders on my family, and also teachers, and I occasionally get caught in small things still just to keep up the facade.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1573338394,StormOJH,30,1,True,2019-11-09

ULPT Some products that offer warranties don’t actually require proof of purchase for a “replacement”,"There are some products that come with warranties when you buy them. On the product’s website, you typically register the product with a free warranty that last the product a couple of years. So if you ever need to replace the product, you just submit a warranty request and an get a new product. 

I found out that some websites don’t actually require you to fill out any warranty registration to claim a warranty. You also don’t need proof of purchase. You just fill out the warranty request, pay the shipping, and they’ll send you a new product without asking for proof of purchase of their product.

I found this out with a specific phone case company. My case eventually messed up, and I realized I never registered it. 2 years later, I went to their website to see if there was anything I could do. I filled out the request, and it basically asked me which case I needed. Then it asked me to pay shipping, and that’s it.

Here I am a few weeks later with a new case, for the price of shipping. I’m sure they’ll change the feature if this catches on too much. Thought I’d share!",UnethicalLifeProTips,1573176524,v3621,1,1,True,2019-11-07

"ULPT: If you break the law (a minor offense, like not paying a speeding ticket) and a warrant is issued for your arrest, you will likely never be served that warrant if you live far enough away from where it happened.","This has to do with the extradition limits the court sets on your warrant; basically how far they are willing to drive to get you and bring you back to their jail. For small offenses, a court may set the extradition limits as surrounding counties, anywhere in the state, or a set distance (example, 250 miles).

Depending on the jurisdiction, the warrant might not even be entered into the national database. If you are in a completely different state then where the warrant was issued, it may not even show up on a background check done by an employer.

The caveat here is that some background checks (like the one you're subjected to before buying a firearm) are more stringent. If your warrant was entered into the national database, it will definitely show up on a serious background check.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1573182054,krzysztofgetthewings,12,1,True,2019-11-07

ULPT: Get free Amazon products by shipping an item to an Amazon locker with your name listed in the address field. Your item will arrive at the locker but the system won't recognize a package with a name. Complain to Amazon that your product didn't arrive (or took &gt; 2 days) and they'll send another.,"I ordered an item through Amazon about a week ago. Instead of choosing an Amazon locker under ""pickup locations,"" I added the locker as a ""new address,"" filled out the fields with the locker's address, and added my name in the appropriate field.

Amazon alerted me that my package arrived to the locker within a day, but it wasn't yet ready for pickup as it takes time to process the packages. I assumed it would be ready for pickup the next day as Prime guarantees two-day shipping, but after three or four days without receiving the pickup code I called Amazon to see what happened.

It turns out that an Amazon locker has difficultly recognizing packages with names listed in the address field (shipping an item through ""pickup locations"" does not put your name on the package). This means that it can take longer than two days for them to sort those packages. Since I couldn't pick up my package within the two-day Prime guarantee, Amazon sent me the same item again for free. The item that I initially ordered was still at the locker so I received the first item after the second one, one they had finally finished processing it.

"ULPT: When your trying to get away with lying, you probably don't need to lie.","I saw a post about lying and it seems there's a decent gap of knowledge in deception. 
If your being confronted with a question that honesty is not in your best interest lying should be one of the last things you should consider.

Avoid the question. Can you steer the conversation away from the topic at hand? If the conversation does not begin with an accusation you can refer back to an older portion of the conversation and say meaningless points stalling allowing public interest to die or simply running out of time ""I have to to to work now I'm late!"" ""I am far too busy for this I still have homework to do..."". 

If conversation is initiated with a question you can't exactly talk about your German Shepard puppy from a conversation two days ago, so you deflect blame. ""Do you think I am the one who did this?!?"" "" Why was your wallet stolen?"" You get the idea distract then always have a vague and plausible scapegoat. The dog ate your food off the counter or must have been some neighborhood kids who stole your pack of cigarettes outside. This works better if your know as an honest person.
This is when you will escalate to lying. Lying is a consumable resource and once it's gone there's almost never getting any back. The more you lie the less truthful you appear no matter how good you are. That last state in particular is a opinion formed from personal experience with lying most of my life as is the advice I'm passing along. Keep the lie simple! They don't need to know your wife was six months pregnant, or the fact you always walk this street at 3:30 pm to head home from work. Innocent people do not explain why they are minding their own business but guilt ridden people feel the need to explain a mustard stain from seven years ago. Such an obvious sign. 

Speaking of few details keep it short but not rushed. If you sort out your lie it will sound like you said it two hundred times in the mirror that morning. Say too much or go to slow increase the risk of showing body language to reduce your chances of appearing innocent. K.i.s.s. 

If you know someone is coming to confront you about a subject you know your dead to rights but they are naive to deception do not attempt to lie. This is almost always a trap as they have evidence showing contrary to what ever statement you will make. Keep a calm or maybe even a slightly annoyed face. Avoid over exaggerating  innocence like a shocked face to a minor event or a quick denial of the situation. Size up the question in your head give it thought a glance to the right is a decent bait. Common misconception is that looking to the right while thinking is forming a lie left honest response. This has been debunked and a quick Google search can prove that. however, do not give them the opportunity to look it up.
 Make an argument of ethos (appeal to authority) as if you are an expert on the subject and correct them on how the information was incorrect or flat out lie. Avoid using illogical conclusion fallacy (example : if I was answering phones in the back of the store! How could I have stolen money from the cash."") It doesn't logially make since and goes against logos (appeal to logic). 
You've been engaged and you've either baited them into an irrelevant question like eyes darting around or you immediately counter with a VALID question that requires a response. If baited question works use that to dismiss the accusation like ""you cannot even  get widely known common knowledge right! How can  we, believe what your saying now?"" Always include any bystanders paying attention no one likes to be alone or have a chance of being wrong. Know your enemy and their insecurities. You can challenge those as character flaws or questionable integrity. 

Now here is when both methods mesh back together. Bury your opponent in again valid questions that would reasonably require a response. Most will struggle to keep up with the pace you should get 5 or 6 our in 30 seconds. This would leave the average Joe in a stupur trying to find answers to all the questions or simply remember them. 

Kick them while they are down. You've just had a challenge to your character assassinate theirs. Knowing the darkest flaws can be pulled out for public display especially if they brought an entnourage on a righteous quest to bring you down ( you know the type). Even generic statements work so often. "" So do you always accuse people without solid evidence?"" "" Is it fun for you to start a witch Hunt here when we have bigger problems to deal with ...current issue
.."" ""what kind of scumbag does this?"" You get it. Make them a bad person it sends a clear two messages. One, this person is illogical and has made an accusation based on what they thought they saw or heard. Two do not challenge me without very solid evidence.

If the person questioning you is an expert liar. This may not mean they lie constantly but they are well informed about deception or simply you are caught red handed.
MINIMIZE! The whole Trump grab em by the *****... He was caught dead to rights. I'm an expert liar jumps to minimizing the accusation itself or personal blame. Well yeah I did that but so did ""Bob, Joe, and Kim! Common what's the big deal wevall do it?"" A part a minimizing is a precieved confession. If you know you left your wallet in a classroom you pulled a prank in and it's too late to cover your tracks confess before an acussation is made and minimize the act and individual blame.

Honorable mention: Bribery. Sometimes the simple act of offering to buy your way out of trouble. Never law enforcement that's just stupid. Never offer what you actually have for two reasons. One it's your money you don't want someone taking you for one hundred dollars when twenty was enough. Also offering a specific amount is ammo for a morally straight person who cannot be bribed. Let's say you have a ten and a one fold the ten over the one and offer twenty dollars. If you are accused of bribing them they will say you pulled out twenty dollars in the form of two tens when infact you do not have this.

ULPT request - Amazon query,"Query for the hive mind... first a little background:

I just completed a simple ""did not arrive"" successfully by chat. Product was 90 dollars. They offered to either refund or replace. Since I use the product regularly, I just had them send another shipment, so basically got a BOGO :-)

I think what made this so simple is that they didn't require signatures on delivery. I simply said I was out of town when delivered, and upon return package was nowhere to be found. Another aspect that I think made the return so easy was that it was an amazon warehouse item... not an item from a third party seller. I think buying from Amazon direct is the way to easier and simpler refunds, or getting a BOGO like I just did.

ULPT: *EXTRA* Free Annual Credit Report Without Any Security Checks.,"Preface (ULPT at the bottom): 

This ULPT came about from making a complaint.

I had issues with account creation at the credit reporting agencies due to them not following the RFC standard/guidance for allowable email address characters (and other issues).

You may already know you can get a free credit report either in digital or hard form via each of the 3 credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) each year. Just cycle around the 3 agencies over 3 years.

For me, it began with one of the agencies not accepting my \*correct\* answers to the security questions, so I couldn't get the digital copy. Calling made no difference.

Fine, I just went with a different agency and got it. Then I made a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) and surprisingly got an unwanted hard copy sent to me in the mail from the original agency. According to them, I failed the security checks (wrong). But later on, I'll find out it came to me because of the complaint where \*NO\* security checks were done.

Then later this year I had to unfreeze my credit report for something. Again, I encounter issues with their site(s) and I make another complaint when customer support was useless.

Again, this instance was about UNFREEZING my report. I had NO interest in another credit report being sent to me.

annualcreditreport (.com) -&gt; ""Contact Us"" -&gt; ""Continue to contact form"" -&gt; ""Other"" -&gt; (check off whatever agencies) -&gt; other -&gt; Description.

This is what I did. You may only need to select one of the other options where you don't have to put in any information (description).

I think my complaint for that second time was about the web site and the useless support, or no way to contact a human.

Again, I'll emphasize that I did NOT want my credit report sent to me, just for them to fix their problems... but both agencies I selected sent me my credit report. Again, no security checks were done, and this is now 2 credit reports from 1 agency received in 1 year.

I'm flummoxed why I was getting these credit reports sent to me and calling support was again like pulling teeth trying to get an explanation. At least that one agency had a different contact phone number on the report that did let me speak to a human.

I finally made one last complaint that was also a test. I selected those agencies again, and explicitly stated that I did NOT want to receive any ""complementary"" credit report sent to me.

You can probably guess that I DID receive another credit report, but only from one of the agencies (so far). That makes it 3 hard copies from that 1 agency in 1 year.

I have no interest in hard copies. I only want the digital form. Being one who cares about the environment, it pains me. Then add on the fact that there is no security involved in getting the credit report shows that nothing was learned from 2017.

This is our society folks, enjoying the ride so far? It's only going to get worse.

I thought about my options and instead of potentially ruining a decent PS4 by trying to solder it myself/put more money into parts + labor, I would try to use switch fraud. My question is, how would I do it best? The PS4 is in pretty much perfect condition and looks untouched. I was thinking to buy a PS4 from Walmart, switch it and return it or do the same thing through Amazon.

"ULPT: Get rid of annoying crap on websites, get around ""please disable adblock...""","So this is pretty simple but you can get fancy with it depending how savvy you are. AdBlock (or a lot of other ad blockers but I know for sure AdBlock and Brave browser work) despite its name can block a LOT more than ads - the way it blocks ads involves finding things that look like they're probably ads, and blocking those.

If you have AdBlock and you rightclick on something on a page, usually it'll say something like ""Block an ad on this page"" and ""Block this ad."" Rightclick whatever you want rid of and mess with the slider until it's gone and looks like you want it to. Anything from the this site uses cookies message to popups that won't let you into the site until you disable AdBlock to just things on your favorite webpages you find annoying. I've used it to disable Youtube recommended video thumbnails with stuff I don't want to see while watching other stuff, like ingrown toenails or whatever, before. This gets rid of that thing forever unless the website changes the code AdBlock uses to identify what it is. There's a blacklist you can see in AdBlock settings so you can take things off it if you want to undo.

Alternative method is if you use Chrome (I think Firefox does it too, been a while since I used others but according to friends some others you have to go turn on the setting) use the inspect/inspect element function in the rightclick menu to bring up the code of the page you're on, highlight what you want to get rid of, and just erase it. This works for things AdBlock has trouble ""seeing"" or doesn't think enough of to even allow you to select as a potential ad. Only works for as long as you have that specific page loaded, before you reload it. You're basically just changing what Chrome is telling your computer to show you personally. (Side note, be wary of screenshots people send you that seem suspicious, it's easy to fake bank account numbers and other stuff with this method.)

ULPT Request: How can I convince a girl to cheat on her boyfriend with me?,"I have been in lust with a lady who is a cashier at a lunch place near where I work. We had flirtatious interactions for months but I didn’t want to ask her out because I didn’t want to pressure her at work. Eventually I decided to hand her a note, asking if she’d like to get a drink sometime. 

She texted me to thank me for the kind note and to say that she had just started dating someone. She then said “I wish you had asked a couple weeks ago I would have loved to.” 

A couple weeks have passed and she is as flirtatious as ever. I’ve met her boyfriend and he’s a really nice guy. But, I am taller than him and I’m in a much more prestigious and well-paid employment than him. This obviously doesn’t make me any more worthy than him, but it might make a difference in her mind. 

I don’t want to break them up (necessarily) but I would really like to see if she would be willing to cheat on him, even just once.

ULPT: Show you boss how hard you are working by scheduling emails to be delivered.,"This is a pretty easy way to make a good impression and buy yourself some valuable time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually arrive to work right around 9:00 and leave right around 5:00 which is very typical. Yesterday, I had someone ask me around 4:30 if I could get something done for them, so I said 'sure I will stay late and finish it'... I knew it wouldn't take long and I wouldn't have to stay late, but my boss and other higher ups in the company were on the email chain. I used the function on Outlook that allows you to schedule message delivery, finished the report, left at 4:50, and had the email deliver at 5:18. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, my boss asked me to send him a spreadsheet when I get a chance tomorrow. Guess who has an email scheduled to be sent at 8:43, 15 minutes before I arrive?

ULPT: My favorite joke/story to pull out at a party/get together with friends and strangers that will definitely get a reaction. It’s worth it i promise.,"I REALLY recommend this one so you just have to hear me out. I have explanations and tips after the joke;

Here it is; **The Monk Story**:

A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?
The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.


The man is disappointed  but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know. 

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth  and tell us how many blades of grass  there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says, I have traveled the earth  and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door  where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door  made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key  from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key  to the last door.

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound...



But he can't tell you because you're not a monk.

**Information:**

If you’ve never read or heard this before i bet it caught you of guard. Try it yourself, just tell the person you’re with right now, family or friends. This should be told in a group setting since this will get a frustrated reaction, good frustrated reaction, they can share the frustration which i’ve noticed is always better.

**Humor:** I’m not a believer in telling jokes in a social situation. Humor is subjective. When you’re telling a joke it’s a gamble if the person finds it funny and it can only make things worse, especially in a group setting which is what i recommend this being told in. Some people like dark humor, puns, meme humor, reference humor, obscure humor and some people hate them. That’s the positive thing about this, it has nothing to with humor but people think it does and prepare in their separate ways. You’re guaranteed to get every type of person; 

The guy just waiting to shit on it, the guy preparing to laugh their ass of, guy preparing to throw out a fake laugh because he doesn’t want you to feel bad, girl who hates jokes, girl who has no humor what so ever and the guy pre-cringing because of fear no one will laugh. It will get every. single. one.

**Experience:** I’ve told this many times to different people at completely different places and i’ve always gotten them. Party, close friends, camping trips with strangers and family. Wildly different groups of people and they still remember it, this really made an impact. This is not a well-known joke either. No one i’ve told has heard it before. The chance of someone having heard it before is very very small so that’s a big plus. If anyone is reading this i’m probably doomed to have some people who actually has heard this before but that’s a very small minority.

**Situations:** There are many different ways you can use this; If things are getting silent or boring, the focus is on you, break the ice, you want to get involved, make an impression, just make an input so you can keep on chilling because you’ve done your part etc. My favorite is making an impression, i love flicking it out since i know i will get people fired up just from such a simple thing. I don’t recommend doing this to complete strangers you’ve just met or in a professional situation.

**Crucial Info:** This is one of the best parts. You can change the story each time to spice it up. My biggest recommendation is saying he drove down a road/place that is well known to the people you’re with, the road in town, the road close by etc, that makes it more personal and it will make them more interested with where this is going. Make the number as long as possible for the grass strands and sand pebbles, add more things for the guy to count. Just make the whole story as LONG as possible, drag it on and on. It’s important to explain how fantastic and amazing the sound is. Go on with the door part, many many doors.

The trick is paying attention to when someone is getting bored or losing focus so you can jump to the next segment very energetically acting like “now is the punchline” to keep them in line. You keep doing this untill the end but don’t over do it. You shouldn’t tell this over text since you can’t see their reaction to hold their interest, people have a tendency to not wanting to read very long texts and it hits harder when it’s face 2 face so don’t waste it on people that you could tell in person. How the joke was told in this post is a weak version of how it should be told because i didn’t want make it too long so no one would read it. You know the people you’re with much better than me, obviously, so you know which details you could use to really get their curiosity rolling.


Like i said if you don’t trust me tell it to the next person you hang out with, you will understand it’s power. You’re never too old for a good joke, especially a new one. Maybe i’m over analyzing this, but it’s worked thus far so i’ll spread the message to the next guy ready for power.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1572421415,ZNSKomplett,17,5,True,2019-10-30

ULPT - How to book a hotel reservation without paying for the room up front at the time of booking,"If you ever need to reserve a hotel room but aren't certain that you will need it, this is how you can reserve it without actually paying for the room.

This only works with most major hotel chains' websites directly, not ""deal"" sites such as Expedia, [hotels.com](https://hotels.com), etc. You will want to book a room online directly through the actual hotel website, such as [hilton.com](https://hilton.com), [marriott.com](https://marriott.com), etc.

Choose your room and go through the booking process online, but when you get to the credit card section for payment or to ""hold"" the reservation, simply enter this as your credit card number:

4111 1111 1111 1111

Then enter any date for the expiration as long as it is a future date. Enter your zip code. Most hotel sites will process the reservation and send you a confirmation email.

Upon checking in, should you actually decide to keep the reservation, give your name and confirmation number from your email. They will say that there was something wrong with the credit card and ask you for a card for payment; then you just hand them your credit/debit card of choice and enjoy your stay. If you decide you don't want to check in (change of travel plans, etc.) the hotel has no way to actually charge you for the room.

I have been doing this for a number of years and so far, most of the hotel chains have not changed their reservation system. I just used it a few weeks ago at a Hilton hotel.

As always, YMMV.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1572373337,msretro1973,10,5,True,2019-10-29

1. Open up a word(or any file really) enter some random text and save that anywhere on your computer.

2. Open said word file with Notepad by right clicking it and select open with option. 

3. Copy a large section but not the whole file text. Make sure to get some weird characters and middle parts and stuff. 

4. Open a new blank word document and paste in your copied text into the new file a few dozen times. Mix up where your pasting it in, don't just keep adding it to the bottom. 

5. Save your new file as homework.doc, no .txt at the end. 

6. Hand file into teacher. 

Now, it should open word and display and error box saying that it can't read the file and that it is corrupted if you did it right. If not, it should at most show just the bullshit random text you typed in at step 1. 

Now obviously don't have the whole class doing this all the time. As you'll screw yourself over. And try to only use it maybe 2 times with the same teacher. Don't want them getting suspicious.

- Tools to remove a toilet seat (usually just a Phillips Screwdriver and gloves)
- Large backpack that can hold a toilet seat
- Shopping Center/Mall with premium seats (Westfield etc.)
- A home in need of a new toilet seat

First you're going to go into a stall and close the door (pick the furthest from the entrance because this is the least used stall). Pull out your tools and get to work. Try and do this during the busy time (after schools finished where I am). If anyone hears you working wait for them to leave, they're not going to be long in there long. Put the seat in your backpack and wash your filthy hands. Now leave the shopping centre. Don't go into any stores as they might want to do a bag check and then it's going to be awkward.

Return three days later with your backpack and the seat you've removed. By now they should've replaced the seat with a brand new one with only a couple of days use. Take out the old seat (you don't want that one trust me) and do the old switcheroo. Take the new seat home and it's yours.

Then drop out of ordering that ticket at the payment screen and go back in to order your actual seats.

2. Scanning pages and upload them as JPGs is faster than copying out pages of text. OCR is too unreliable.

ULPT Request: Failed bank transaction (with TLDR),"Hello,

(I apologize in advice for my Enghlish as it's not my first language).

**tldr at the end.**

About 9 days ago I've sent money to my girlfirend (half rent, wifi, etc.), but transaction somehow failed and until this day she didn't arrived money that also disappeard from my account. At the beggining I've been waiting, because transaction could be just delayed and I didn'I want to be hystorical. After 5 days of waiting, I've start to solve the problem. First I've ask on online chat what happen and the guy was very helpful and gave me telephone number to call some specialist that would trace and resolve my problem. Unfortunately, next day I've been waiting long time to connect me with specialist, which would not be able to trace my transaction for some reason and tell me to in 15 minutes). So I've called again and some girl (I don't know she's name but she was not the mentioned specialist, but was very nice to me and tolerable to my weak ensglish. But only thing I've been informate about was that transaction was lost and I should call next day to different number when they help me and resolve my problem.

And as I'm poor eastern European man trying to achieve better life for me and my girlfriend, definitely not bad person, but struggling with finances, I would like to get some advice how can I mine some money from this event. I will not hurt anybody from nice staff, I just want some advice how can I mine some money from the corporation.

My girlfriend is not dying from starvation, she was also able to make a deal with rent payment. I just want some advice how to exploit this situation for some smooth self-enrichment.

Thank you for every advice and sorry againt for consufed speech and syntax errors, I hope it's readable for you.

tldr:

I'm currently living in England, my girlfriend is living in Czech Republic. I've sent her money for half rent, wifi etc., but they didn't arrived on time. After 5 days I've started to solve the problem with live chat, making calls etc. Staff was nice, but in 9th day I've found out my transaction was somehow lost and I should call again tomorrow. My girlfriend have still some money and got a deal with houseowner to pay rent less. Could you give me some advice, my friends, how can I mine money from this corporation mistake?

"ULPT: If given the option to rent either the upstairs or basement apartment of a house, choose the upstairs apartment even if it is more expensive. In the winter months, you can exploit thermodynamics and modern technology to leech heat from downstairs and save big on heating.","  This pro tip relies upon four facts of thermodynamics and modern house design:

1. Thermodynamics tells us that heat spontaneously flows from hot places towards the cold.

2. Heat rises because heating air causes it to expand and rise above the more dense cold air. 

3. Home thermostats are designed to turn on the heat when the room temperature falls below a certain point. When the temperature is above that point, the furnace cuts out. 

4. Insulation between floors tends to be lesser between floors rather than in the walls.

If you are a morally dubious home renter occupying the upstairs apartment, you can use these facts to stay warm on your neighbours’ dime. To stay warm in the winter, the downstairs tenants will set their thermostat to a high temperature. If you intentionally set your thermostat to a much lower temperature, you are creating a natural less insulated path for the warm air downstairs to rise towards. 

As the heat leaves their apartment and goes into yours, their thermostat will signal to their furnace to keep cranking out heat. Meanwhile, your furnace will rarely activate because of the trickling in heat and lower set point. You will not be as warm as the people downstairs per se, but you won’t be footing the as much of a bill.

And if the downstairs neighbours are new tenants, there is zero probability of them realizing something is amiss because they will have no previous winters to compare against.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1571619068,SweatervestDude,10,1,True,2019-10-20

"ULPT: Download, Keep and Share Audible content via both the Audible app or MP3 Conversion!","So, while fucking around trying to make sure I wouldn't lose all of the audio books me and my now ex partner had (we shared our audible account), i figured the download to device option meant that the files had to be stored on my phone somewhere.... so i found them and planned to convert them to mp3 to keep forever. 

Turns out people must have been doing this previously and Audible worked it out. Anyone with the latest version of the app have different downloaded file types(AAXC) compared to the older versions of the app which download the files in AAX format. 

I uninstalled the Audible app on my old phone (galaxy note 8), reinstalled using the apk for the May 2019 version of the app and badabing badaboom, the files started downloading in AAX and not in AAXC. This meant I could transfer these files to my MacBook, and then download and use openaudible to convert the files to MP3 (openaudible does not have conversion capabilities for AAXC yet)... So I now have permanent copies of these files stored separate to the Audible app. But wait, it gets better...

Additionally, I created my own new audible account on my current phone (galaxy note 10+) which has the current version of audible installed. I transferred all of the AAX files into the audible file storage location for my new account. I could access all of the audio books using files downloaded from somebody else's (My ex's) audible account. 

It does realise you dont own the rights to the books occasionally and removes them from your library (yet doesnt delete the files), so to restore them back into your audible book device list, you simply go to your library, click the three dots in the top right corner and hit refresh. It resyncs any AAX/AAXC files sitting in your audible file folder on your device. 

So if you have friends and family who all use audible, you can send the downloaded AAX/AAXC files between yourselves via wifi transfer or Bluetooth, move them to the correct file storage location and all of a sudden you have access to listen to books that your friend or family member has purchased and visa versa.

ULPT: Want to save a few bucks while shopping?,"Go to the self checkout and ""forget"" to scan one or two items.

Guidelines:

Obviously, make sure you have enough items to make it subtle. Don't bring up five items and scan one. Two ""non scans"" for every ten is the absolute limit.

Make sure you still perform the motion of scanning, just make sure you obstruct the barcode or tilt the item so it doesn't ring up.

There's usually one employee watching the self checkout area, which consists of multiple machines. They are generally too busy or too jaded to pay attention to everyone. Trust me, they are NOT watching anyone closely enough to see if you scanned everything.

Do NOT do this with the most expensive item. You want plausible deniability. You can explain a $2.99 coffee as a mistake, less so with a $60 Bluetooth headset.

Bottom line, ideal scenario you walk out, no one the wiser. Worst case scenario, someone notices and you play it off as a mistake. Nobody is going to question it, especially since you bought the majority of the items. Just like with everything, play it cool and know your limits.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1571174475,GarrisonMills,30,6,True,2019-10-15

ULPT: Save some money buying movie tickets,"Want to save some money while going to see a movie?

A lot of the recommendations suggest buying a child or senior ticket. There's a better option if you're willing to be a little deceiving. 

Hospitals have a ton of staff and contractors are hired all the time. If live near a hospital, pass one heading to work, or just are stopping by make sure to step into the gift shop. 

Theaters make most of their money from concessions so they're willing to sell tickets cheaper as part of a hospital's benefits to get people in the door. My local theater sells tickets for $11.50 but hospital employees can get them for $8. 

Simply ask to buy a movie ticket from the gift shop and get it at the discounted price. If the gift shop employee asks for ID or if you work there tell them that you're a contracted employee and they haven't given you an ID yet.  They usually dont have access to employee databases and won't question you. 

If for whatever reason they catch on to your deception just tell them your friend who works at the hospital sent you to purchase on their behalf.

Possible problems:
Some hospitals sell their discounted tickets out of their HR department which will be able to catch on if you're lying.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1570974036,MaxedRed,0,1,True,2019-10-13

ULPT: How to become as successful as Thomas J. Wilson of Allstate Insurance Company.,"The simple answer as to why Allstate has been able to survive all these years doesn't come down to talent, strategy or influence. The simple answer is that they cheat. They lie and cheat use their army of lawyers to protect themselves. So in this essay we'll review all the methods they use to perpetrate their con. We'll cover bribing, breaking Federal Laws, and breaking guidelines set by the Department of Insurance.

We'll start with the easy one which is bribing. You can always tell which leader someone belongs to by the vehicle they drive. Each senior leader at Allstate has enamored him or herself with either the owner of a car dealership or one of their sales people. You see, a vehicle is the worst financial investment someone can make. It depreciates immediately after leaving the lot and often times the resale value only comes into play if you purchase a new vehicle every 4-5 years. So bribing employees with vehicles achieves two goals. The first is it puts the employee into debt. This ensures they have to maintain a job if they hope to make the payments. The second goal is to allow them to frame you for taking a bribe should you decide to do something other than what they cram down your throat. So it all comes down to keeping you enslaved to them and unable to leave or go anywhere else. How do they keep you from going anywhere else? Well, that brings to my second point which is breaking Federal Laws.

Allstate, over the course of years, has not only created economic slaves for itself, but has strategically placed key individuals at other corporations. When you want to break Federal Laws, it helps to be able to cover your tracks and if you're able to infiltrate some of the largest most influential tech companies, it helps all the more. They have used their influence to extract private personal data from US Citizens without their knowledge or their consent. But this sounds like an illegal wiretap? Yep. Illegal wiretaps, digital or physical, are a Federal crime. Allstate has offices in both Northern Ireland and India. Both do not fall within Federal jurisdiction of the United States of America. This is where they deploy, monitor and extract personal information from citizens of the United States. To be very clear, they actively pursue personal data from citizens of the United States. Why do they do this? Well, not only does it allow them to enact social justice as they see fit outside of any court of law. It allows them to actively and aggressively measure risk of individuals. This brings me to my third point, which is breaking guidelines set by the Department of Insurance.

The Department of Insurance is a regulatory body that regulates various facets of the insurance industry and professionals. The key areas being health, auto, homeowners and life insurance products. The DOI sets guidelines regarding the profiling of risk to protect the consumer from unfair pricing. How does it do that? It only allows insurance companies to set risk as small as geographic area codes. Any smaller and they could individually assign risk to a single household or even an individual. Insurance works because we spread the risk among a group of individuals. By bypassing this guideline, Allstate seeks to individually calculate risk of households and ""beat the system"" so to speak so they can pad their profits. Under all the fluff of all the various business units within Allstate is a group of individuals that mines the ill gotten data and uses it to create risk assessments of various households within the United States. The other departments are simply there to manufacture the ""evidence"" that they were operating within the guidelines set by the Department of Insurance. These are bright individuals with absolutely no morals or ethics. Often times they use contractors to keep Allstate hands clean. How have they not gotten caught? As I mentioned before, when you have influence into some of the largest technology companies in the world, you can cover your digital tracks quite well as they have done.

So in conclusion, to become as successful as Thomas J Wilson, CEO of Allstate, you have bribe, break Federal laws, and ignore all guidelines set by the Department of Insurance while creating enough business units to appear like you came to your calculations actually using data that is freely available to everyone. This requires you to throw away your morals, have absolutely no respect for the law, and decide that anyone and everyone can be forced to do what you want them to do. Does this sound like a man you want to follow? Not to me.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1570906286,SrHaenBethnam,1,0,True,2019-10-12

ULPT [Request] A neighbor who is saving a public spot with his motorcycle.,"So as the season starts to get cold more and more motorcyclists are swapping to cars.

In my apartment complex there are 3 types of spots:


-Public (they’re blank) 

-Paid (they’re numbered) 

-Handicap (obviously marked as such) 

A person (of unknown identity) has parked their motorcycle in a public spot where the parking rules explicitly state that you must move your vehicle every 72 hours.

This person has parked their bike at the grass end of a parking spot and every day they park their car in the spot with their motorcycle.

They have essentially created a permanent spot for themselves. 

I attempted to notify my office but they did not respond. 

My roommates and I have now left 2 notes on his car warning him to stop.

I’ve got a lot of ideas on how to get the picture across to this guy.

What can I do that will really ruin his day and ensure he won’t continue to do it? 

My favorite idea so far is putting cat poop under his driver door handle.

ULPT Tired of a shitty work environment at a big chain? Leave a fake negative review.,"This doesn't apply to jobs where people from the outside never see, so you can't get a better computer at an office nobody goes into. Also, you have to be at a big chain that actually cares about reviews since they have the money and motivation to make changes.

It won't work at local/small businesses or places that corporate has abandoned. They likely won't have the resources or will to make a change. Look for responses to reviews that say ""We're so sorry that your ghost pepper wings were spicy! Please come in and have a free meal for you and your family of 8."" They will literally eat your asshole to get that sweet 5 star review.

Do they make you work alone as cashier on all busy nights? Well Dale Hannoway gives 1 star because it took him 30 minutes to buy one item. Expect to see 1 or 2 more registers open.

Tired of run down bathrooms? Well Benita Ortiz gave 1 star because the stall door didn't close and the graffiti was racist. Oh no, she uploaded a picture as well! Expect to see renovations or maybe a deep cleaning service come by.

Tired of repairing broken things?  Well Robert Thurman gave 1 star because the automatic napkin dispenser didn't work anymore. Expect to see a new one installed.

Do you hate having to badger customers every 2 seconds with whatever lines corporate feeds you? Well David Hanley, Moe Abdullah, Debbie Sheiner, and Paul Worth feel attacked by the super aggressive sales techniques. Expect to do it less or not at all.

ULPT: Gotten into a small fender-bender? Ignore calls from claims adjuster and you'll be fine.,"We were a victim of this ULPT.

As long as there is no statement from that person, their insurance doesn't need to pay out!

The insurance company will ask the following questions:

Is my spouse a witness? NOPE. She's not an ""INDEPENDENT witness"" as per my insurance as she was ""involved"" in the accident,"" as a passenger.

Is there a police report? Of course not!! It's a minor fender bender!

This leaves me SOL, with no recourse but to sue the other driver and take them to small claims court... which of course, I'm not going to do because the damage/time investment isn't worth it.

Another point to mention is that both the at-fault driver and I have GEICO.

ULPT Request - How to piss off inconsiderate loud neighbors,"Sorry for the formatting. I’m On mobile. 

So I live in a duplex outside of city limits. But it’s a very tiny 2 bedroom. They’ve got 6 adults, a teenager, 2 toddlers, and 3 dogs living in that itty bitty place. They’ve constantly got at least 4 cars parked in a one spot carport. 

My neighbors are constantly hitting the walls and slamming doors. Now I live with my husband and 6 month old baby. And I try to recall any time I’ve touched or hit the walls and I can only think of a time or two and it was completely on accident. 

But when I say constantly, just last night at 4 am I jumped awake to them slamming things around in their house and proceeded to wake my baby. I’ve tried talking to them but it just seems like they’re careless. My landlord is an old lady who is going through dementia. I’ve asked her to help me get the neighbors to calm down a little bit. Every time she does, she suggests that I talk to them myself. Which I have. I’ve mentioned how they have entirely too many people living there but the neighbors claim that those people are just visiting. Every day. And night. Since they moved in. 

And something else minor but somehow it seems like someone is always outside smoking. So it stinks outside too. And they smell like absolute garbage and butt hole. I don’t even know how to explain it. It just smells horrendous over there. And they’re always outside talking and cackling. The toddlers also run around naked and screaming so loud I can hear them over the tv. I’m not sure how they’re banging the walls and slamming doors and being outside at the same time but there’s enough humans in that house it doesn’t surprise me anymore. 

I feel somewhat bad because the teenage kid likes to help out by raking our yard and looking out for snakes. He’s also helped when my dog escaped our yard. It just seems like everyone in that house is obliviously slamming things. It’s affecting us so much that we don’t really get any sleep anymore. My baby can’t take naps without constantly being interrupted. 

Any ideas on how to piss them off? Persuade them to move? Get back at them? Anything to give them a taste of their own medicine? 

I thought about getting a water gun of liquid ass and spraying it all over their yard and front porch. Maybe that’ll make them less inclined on staying around much. We share the same air conditioner so I can’t sabotage that. And they’ve made it clear that they have guns.

ULPT: How to survive in America as a white supremacist and make lots of money.,"So you've decided that the white race is superior to all other races and now you want to be rich. Well, boy do I have a plan for you. Apply to work at Allstate. Allstate fosters white supremacists and social justice warriors. In fact, if you throw a minority under the bus, they'll promote you as being a great leader.

Allstate is mostly comprised of white conservative Republicans that believe they are superior to all minorities. They will test your skills and knowledge. So your best chance at evading detection is to pin it on some unsuspecting minority. Throw them under the bus and you'll have droves of other white social justice warriors rising to your defense. They travel in packs there. Under the rule of grand wizard Thomas J. Wilson. Make up excuses like ""I already told (so-and-so minority)"" or ""I have no idea why (so-and-so minority) would do that"" all the while knowing full well that it was your responsibility. That brings me to my second point, which is passing the buck.

Passing the buck should become second nature to you. Find minorities who will join your team and convince them you're a great leader by speaking loudly and fawning over you boss. You'll quickly rise as a super star. Win over your white stakeholders with phrases like ""I wonder what that would do to the combined ratio."" You'll find yourself in the spotlight ready to squash any minorities that try to get ahead in life. Remember, to pull this off you have to become really angry at any minority that speaks out against any white person even if you know they are in the right. Remember to scream at the top of your lungs at the minority so that everyone in the vicinity will hear. They will fear you, but respect you for your white supremacist social justice boner. ""Now **that** is a great leader"" they'll say. ""Look at how big and tall his social justice boner is."" You'll garner the favor of other social justice warriors that also throw minorities under the bus and soon you'll find an entire network of white supremacists at your disposal. With your new found friends, you can now begin to make boat loads of money.

Making money at Allstate is pretty easy. They don't pay very well, but since you're white and a social justice warrior, you'll start off much higher than all the minorities in the company. However, that won't be enough. One of easiest ways to make money there is to hire more people. Immigrants minorities are the prime target. You'll get $1K for each head and once they're in you get to be the white savior to their parents and you'll have an economic slave that will do your work for you. The more you hire, the less you work. Remember, if they decide to act out or defy you in any way, tap their parents and talk about how you're ""concerned"" about them. They'll whip their kid into shape even though you've just lied to their face. Remember, you're white, everything you say is the truth even if you're lying through your teeth. These minorities won't know what hit them until it's too late.

So in conclusion, if you're a white supremacist social justice warrior living in the United States, you can gain employment and wealth by working for Allstate. They'll teach you to lie to minority parents, pass the buck and throw minorities under the bus, and how to make money by shitting on the lives of minorities. Working at Allstate as a white supremacist social justice warrior is like becoming a great white savior. Just remember, leave your ethics and morals at the door because who the fuck cares about those when you can makes lots of money, beat minorities over the head with your great big justice boner, and sit back doing nothing and watch the money roll in.

The plan: I am going to have a friend pull a ticket for the parking garage and use that ticket to get my own car out. Then, I was going to pay the 15 dollars a day for the lost ticket for him and pay the regular ticket price for the one he pulled. I am sure they are still going to send me another ticket but at this point 52 dollars will be cheaper then paying the 15 dollars per day my car has been in there for. My question is when my friend goes to pull out after myself are they going to see that his ticket was already paid for by somebody else? Also, how do they know how long your car has been in the parking garage for? I know they go around and write down the license plate numbers but they can't go back to the footage every time someone lost a ticket and track when they pulled in because it is so busy it'd hold up the entire parking garage. If anybody can give me any answer on that i'd be super appreciated because I can't afford paying over 300 dollars right now :(. I am super stressed out and wouldn't have parked in the garage in the first place if I knew I received a ticket for sneaking out the first time. Which not that it matters but the first time I pulled out of the garage by my roommate I didn't even have a ticket when I pulled in the garage because they opened the gates because there was suppose to be a bad hurricane so they left it open for anybody to park in. Also, pulling out again behind my friend is a no-go because apparently they called him threatening to take away his parking pass if the same car sneaks out behind him again.  


If anybody can give me any tips, different plans, or answers it'd be greatly appreciated as learning this news has added such a huge stress onto me and is give me a huge amount of anxiety. Thanks!  


\*Also, I saw that you can use a magnetic strip to pull a different ticket but this wouldn't work because the parking garage entrance has an employee there 24/7.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1570658759,Crypto2theMoonPhil,9,0,True,2019-10-09

I'm a mediocre looking guy and have been always around women/girls. From work to dates. Dating quite a lot of girls etc. showed me that a lot of pretty girls have bland personalities. From girls with families in top of millionaires in Europe to girls that are quite big in the modelling life. I've seen them all. 

Now, i'm in a relationship with a 4/10 and I've never been the happiest as I am today. Supportive, wants to make you happy and the sex is great. There is room for improvement as how she looks, but her personality is a 11/10.

And what makes them better than the ""pretty"" girls, is the fact that they know they can't date a lot of guys thus keeping you happy as much as they can. While the 9/10 wants to feel jealousy from how much attention you get and wants to chase they guy instead the other way around.

"ULPT: Tailgating ACTUAL SOLUTION, last post about tailgating was nonsense. Here is what you do:","I never get tailgated anymore. 

When someone is tailgating you, just hold down your windshield washer. If you look closely in your rear view mirror, you can see it soaking the car behind you. The hood, the windshield, everything. 

This will do two things:

1) If it’s a nice car, and as nice cars are usually washed and meticulously clean, it will leave washer fluid all over it so their clean car is now annoyingly dirty with washer fluid marks.

ULPT - How To Get Free Subscriptions Online,"I am a student and I am big broke rn. 

I want to stream Hulu and Spotify and all that and tweak box is honestly annoying and I'm not voiding any warranties by jailbraking my phone let alone have it on my xbox and laptop. This led me down a deep dive in youtube where I found a video with like 50 views but it was amazing.

It lead me to a website called [nulled.to](https://nulled.to). Its not on like the dark web but it got some weird stuff on it. It has every subscription imaginable (excluding youtube red and Netflix) for either cheap or even free. There's entire private stores for accounts and subscription. You can also see entire list (the website calls them dumps) of 100s of the accounts and its all free just need an account. 

I have been using these accounts for Hulu and tidal and only have to get a new one every month or so which is fine because its free. I even get my friends accounts so they don't have to pay either. I also use it for nordVPN because it is expensive and works really well. I even ended up getting photoshop for free. It is really great. I have been doing this for a year and no issues yet except others will change passwords and whatnot to which I really just get another one from the lists. 

Theres definitely an illegal side of the website (if you don't count all that I said already) where people sell receipts for stuff to get warranty a replacements without having the actual product but I do not use it.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1570471042,benje17X,6,1,True,2019-10-07

"ULPT Request: Does gig reselling still work (fiverr, upwork)","Hi everyone.

A few years back I heard about the excellent opportunity of online gig reselling.

This is where you freelance on sites like fiverr and upwork doing some kind of design work. But every time you get a gig you find someone that will do the job for cheaper than you and you pay them to do it, deliver their work to your client and keep the excess (so you're just a middle-man).

But I heard some people say that this no longer works, although I can't imagine why.

I understand it may take some work to get established on these sites, and you may have to take a loss re-selling some gigs for less than you earn before you build up your trust.

Leys get to it. A few weeks ago I was at a junction when some woman drove into the back of me at low speed. Maby 7km she claims. This damaged paint work however there was damage already there so I'm not bothered about that. We exchanged details but did not get the police or insurance companies involved as both our premiums would go up.

So I got it serviced to make sure the internals were OK. A wheel bearing needed change at a cost of about $200. I asked her for the money and she has basically said my car is old with a lot of milage and when bearings go they make noise so she doesn't think the crash did that damage but if I disagree we can get the police involved.

I'd like her to cover the bill because I don't have much money right now but I don't want the insurance company to know or my premium will go up. I have a text where she admitted it was her fault.

What is the best course of action. Do nothing or do something and risk the insurance company finding out?

ULPT Request: How to avoid getting a 3rd roommate added to a college double room,"At the start of the semester I had a triple, until one of my roommates decided to move to a different dorm on campus. For the past little while we have had our room to just the 2 of us, but now the college housing department is emailing telling us they are looking for a 3rd to fill our vacant spot. They are sending us a form to fill out, which includes questions of our preferences for roommates. 

Our ideas so far have been:

* Pretend like we hate each other (and/or our habits/preferences are opposite) and a 3rd will just up the conflict
* Not respond to the email
* Say one of us has a friend transferring from another college next semester and we want to room with him
* Choose the opposite responses on the housing form (e.g. I will say I prefer to live with someone who *does* smoke, and he will say he prefers to live with someone who *doesn't* smoke).

ULPT: You could easily steal my Chipotle order,"Every time I’d previously picked up an online, paid Chipotle order, I’d say “I’m here for a pickup,” and they’d fill-in “for [u/Cobra\_McJingleballs](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cobra_McJingleballs/)?” and I'd say ""yeah."" Without any verification it was me, they just handed me my meal.

So I was originally going to post that and say “hey, free Chipotle strategy.”

———

But now, they’ve moved mobile orders (at my location anyway) from behind the counter to in front of the counter. Today was my first experience with that.

I saw my name tag on a takeout bag, fell in line, and said “I’m here to pickup for Cobra\_McJingleballs.” She’s like, “is your order already back there?” I said “yeah.” She’s like “then you prepaid and you're all set!”

So I guess in the future I don’t even have to check in? I can just take my bag? What’s to stop anyone from just walking in and taking my prepaid order?

Assuming the prepaid takeout bags were behind the counter, still, what’s to stop someone from seeing my name on the label (the receipts are always stapled to the bag with the customer’s name in bold print), and saying “here to pickup for \[name on takeout label\]”?

Honestly surprised there hasn’t been an epidemic of Chipotle food theft, or that I have yet to not have someone have already claimed my order.

I have just received it back and it seems to work fine, however the company that delivered it reported that the package was damaged.

Now that it's no longer under warranty, it will likely break in a little while and I'll be force to pay lot to get it fixed or pay a lot for a new computer.

However due to the fact that the package was reported damaged, the computer company asked for photos of the laptop to assess the damage.

I believe if I make my computer seem more damaged than it is then I might be able to get a free one.

ULPT: Get free gift cards from major chain restaurants by complaining.,"I used to do this in college when I was poor and starving. Go to any major chain restaurant website and head to the ‘Contact Us’ section of the site. Carefully email them about your horrible experience with your family, significant other or friend. Tell them how disappointed you are because it was a special occasion and the horrible experience has lead you to never want to eat there again. Make sure to tell them you’ve never had these kinds of issues before and are very disappointed things turned out this way. 

Leave a good email and phone number with them because in my experience someone may call you to follow up. As long as you can stick to your story and detail what outraged you they will offer a GC as compensation to come back and try again with them to make it up. A week or 2 later the GC will arrive in the mail and the restaurant and staff are non the wiser when you use it. 

Here are some tips I’ve learned when doing this:

1) Never give your server an actual name. Don’t get anyone in real trouble. I always say they weren’t wearing a name tag and because it was busy you can’t remember their name. The name tag thing usually irks them more. Just give a basic one off description. 

2) Never say you paid with a credit card. They will search the the transaction logs to see if your name matches any CC receipts. Always say you paid in cash. They can’t track it. 

3) You want to tell them the food was cold, undercooked, or late. Refills were almost non existent. I always say the server was hard to track down. 

4) Keep your party size small. I always say 2-4 people. Make it bigger at your own risk. 

5) Always tell them it was a Friday or Saturday. Busy days are usually met with tons of people and it’s harder to keep track. 

6) Know your menu. Make sure you know what everyone in your party ate. Make it very common and popular menu items. If you get too crazy expensive then the I used cash option looks odd. 

7) Be prepared to speak to someone. They do call to apologize and hear more about your story. Not all of them (chili’s doesn’t fucking care) but some do. They give a more personal touch. 

8) Do your restaurant research. Some chain restaurants fall under the same parent company so they all have the same complaint department. For example, Olive Garden is owned by Darden Co. They also own Long Horn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s Kitchen, Capital Grill etc. you don’t want to do this to more than one of the same restaurants under the bigger parent company. You will get caught quick. Just google: who owns X restaurant and see everything. 

9) Wait some time before doing this repeatedly to the same restaurant. I usually wait a year, but you can proceed at your own risk. 

10) Enjoy your free corporate meal.

ULPT: How to dispose of a body by u/frenchy318,"

First, pulverize all his teeth, burn off the fingerprints, and disfigure his face. This will force a DNA test to establish identity (if it ever comes to that) which might introduce the legal/forensic hurdle that saves your ass down the line. An unidentifiable body can, in a pinch, be dressed in thrift store clothes and dropped in a bad part of town where the police are less likely to question it. I don't recommend that disposal method, I'm just saying an easily identifiable body is an even bigger threat than the opposite. If you're in a house where you have some time to work, get the body in the bathroom. The first thing you want to do is drain it of fluids. This will make it easier to cut up, and slow decomposition a little bit. The best way to do this quick and dirty is to perforate the body with a pointed knife, and then perform CPR on it. Cut the fronts of the thighs deep, diagonally, to slit the femoral arteries. Then pump the chest. The valves in the heart will still work when dead, and the springback of the rib cage can apply a fair amount of suction to the aorta. Do this in the tub. Plug the drain, and mingle lots of bleach with the bodily fluids before unplugging the drain to empty the tub. This should help control the stench of death, which would otherwise reek from your gutter gratings. Do everything you can to control odors. Plug in an ionizer, burn candles, leave bowls of baking soda everywhere. Ventilate the room in the middle of the night, but otherwise keep it closed. Keep the body under a plastic sheet while it's in the tub. If you want to bury it, I recommend separating the body into several parts, and burying them separately. For one thing, it's easier to dig a deep enough hole for a head by itself than it is for an entire body. This reduces your chances of being discovered while you are actually outside and digging the grave. That is the one thing you can't do inside and it represents a vulnerable moment so you want to keep it brief, (under 2 hours). Do it between 3 and 5 am. Also, it's less likely for someone to call the police if their dog digs up some chunk of meat, than if they dig up an entire body. They may assume it's an animal carcass disfigured by decomposition, and leave it alone or dispose of it. It's also more likely that the dog will consume all of it before anyone knows the difference. A whole skeleton is another story. You can cut a body into 6 pieces faster than you think. It's not much different than boning a chicken, but it takes more work, a big knife, and time. A hammer will be useful for pulverizing joints or driving the knife deep where it doesn't want to go. Anyway it's wise to crush as much of the skeleton as you can along the way. It will aid in making the body less identifiable for what it is as it decomposes. Don't return to the same site 6 times for 6 burials.You'll attract suspicion from anyone nearby, and you'll wind up placing the body parts close enough together to be found by any serious investigation. Put them in plastic bags with lots of bleach, and store in a freezer until you have enough time to bury them all. Depending on what tools you have available, you may find that you're getting really good at deconstructing the body. You might prefer to slowly sprinkle it down a drain without leaving your house. This avoids the long-term risk of discovery associated with burial, and the overwhelming supply of bacteria in a sewer accelerates decomposition, while providing a convenient cover smell. Truly grinding down a body takes a lot more work, and you run the risk of fouling your plumbing and calling in a plumber. So don't try it unless you know how to clear bones and meat out of a drainpipe. A good food processor can be useful. But don't over-use it, or power drills or saws. They're noisy and they attract attention. And forget the kitchen sink. It's better to use the toilet which will give you direct access to one of the largest sewer pipes that exits your house. Follow any disposals with lots of bleach and then run the water for 5 or 10 minutes on top of that. Once you are finished you will need to completely clean the area and remove all traces of what happened with bleach. Remember, blood tends to seep into all sorts of unlikely places. you will want to pull the baseboards to remove any evidence of bodily fluids that has soaked into the corners, also remove and replace the wax sealing ring in the base of the toilet. Those things act as a magnet, collecting evidence of everything that you flushed down. Don't forget to check the ceiling, blood spatter often ends up there and gets overlooked during the cleaning. Now comes the most important part. Keep your mouth shut! Too many people are caught because they let something slip. The sooner you can start thinking about what happened as nothing more than a story you once heard or a dream that you once had the better. Distance yourself from it and let the memory fade.

ULPT Request: How can I legally purchase a car only to park in front of my neighbor’s house to piss them off?,"So basically, the parking in my neighborhood is pretty bad, so I park the next neighborhood over. There is a creek running through this neighborhood with about 200 feet of parking next to it, which is always empty. It’s not in front of anyone’s house and shouldn’t be bothering anyone. Yet the residents of this neighborhood have not taken kindly to this. They’ve yelled at me repeatedly, smoked around my car, adjusted my mirrors, etc. Today was the final straw though. They decided to park one of their cars in the EXACT spot that I park my car in. There is no reason to do this other than to piss me off. Needless to say, I found another parking spot, but I want to get revenge on them. Here’s what I was thinking: I’d buy an old, shitty car for cheap, maybe $500 to $1000. I’d pay the registration on it to make it street legal, then park it in the spot. After I feel I’ve successfully gotten revenge, I’ll sell the car and hopefully get the same amount I purchased it for (or at least, lose as little money in the process as possible). My concerns are:

1. How can I verify that the spot I’m parking in is a legal parking spot?

2. My house is in a private neighborhood. Is there anything preventing me from parking this car in the neighbor’s public neighborhood?

3. How can I purchase / sell the car without losing money?

4. How often do I need to move the car to prevent it from getting towed?

5. Is there anything illegal about any of this? Literally my only reason for this purchase is to be petty.

6. Is there a better way to get revenge than this?

You've given up what you evidently needed out of the other woman and have decided that your marriage is worth much more.  You've made the right decision and you'll be rewarded for it with many more years of continual growth with your best friend.

You'll now have to choose the right time and manner in which to tell her.  I highly recommend telling her immediately after making love.  This is when she will be the most relaxed and feel the closest to you.  Start out by making yourself cry.  It helps to think of something heartbreaking in order to open the floodgates.  For me, it was reliving the moment when Dee Ford jumped off sides, negating what would have been Tom Brady's fourth interception and Patriot's loss in the AFC championship game to my Kansas City Chiefs.  

Upon seeing your tears, your wife will likely become very concerned and ask you what's wrong.  This is when you come out with it.  Start by telling her about all the things she has done wrong that ultimately drove you in to the arms of another woman, and describe the areas in which she can improve.  Play up being the victim and maintain that you were forced in to a horrible situation by her actions or lack thereof.  Your wife will feel guilty that she has pushed you in to infidelity and will want to fix things and be a better spouse so that this never happens again.  But don't put it entirely on her.  Be an adult and take some responsibility and blame as well.  Explain to her your weakness for women that work out and maintain killer bodies, cook like gourmet chefs and have insatiable appetites in the bedroom.  Helping her understand that you have weaknesses too will ultimately bring you closer together.

ULPT - Are you a fat chick or fat dude that likes to show off their goods and can stand for a while and wanna make alright money? Contact an art school to be a nude model. Fat people are chosen over skinny people cause gesture drawing fat people is more pleasing shape wise than drawing skinny.,"Stating this cause I went to art school for 4 years and illustrtion early years its a basoc requirement at most schools to do. Fat people have more shape and curves to them which is great for capturing quick gesture drawings; reason why fat people in old paintings look so good is cause the fat allows for more dimension and captures soft details. I remember we had more out of shape middle aged people than younger skinnier people cause the shape was more pleasing to draw and cause finding a toned young person with muscle that wanted to do nude modeling was hard to find cause on mentally they thought we were judging them. I also guess cause in your middle age, you just don't give a shit like a 20 year something would.

If you are worried people will talk shit about you at a nude model session cause you don't look like a chiseled greek god, don't. We're there to capture the shape your body makes up; you're essentially an object we try to capture visibly well and fat people make up a lot of complex shapes and lines that make for good studies.

It helps if you can find the stupidest person in your school/work environment to sell to.

First time I ever did this was in 8th grade. Sold this kid a bluetooth speaker that i told him costed $150 in store/online and that the battery lasted 25 days. I sold it to him for $50 the next day.

Refuse to communicate verbally. Text or email only so it can be documented.  
Lock him out of the Wi-Fi. 
Separate all of my dishes and cookware, leaving a note on the cabinet that he is not to use any of them.

 If you cannot think of any other exception, start a sentence with ”but what if there’s an emergency and...” and just say whatevet string of words that crossed your mind.

 This is a very effective way to annoy almost anyone, and waste literal hours of their time. If you buckle up and double down hard enough, the only way to make the argument stop is for your victim to give up and admit that yes, there probably might have been at least one single incident in the world history of everything, where this almost-entirely-impossible situation you just cooked up might have happened, and therefore ”horses don’t eat human babies” is factually wrong.

It made me wonder what could be on the phone that was worse than proof of him cheating. Was there proof of other more serious things?

ULPT Clean out your credit report and increase your score by filing disputes for fraud.,"ULPT Download the credit karma app and setup a free account.  Go through your accounts that have been placed in collections and file a dispute. When asked for a reason for your dispute, simply select the option for claiming the account isn’t yours or your information was fraudulently used.

 **I’ve tried this only with accounts thatI have never made a payment on (as soon as you make a payment, you are assuming ownership of the account).** 

In less than a month, all four accounts I had were removed from my credit reports and my score increased by almost 100 points.

I think this works due to the fact that the original creditor will sell the account to a collections for pennies on the dollar. Debt collectors buy these accounts in bulk and oftentimes don’t even have the proper paperwork for them. When you file a dispute, collection agencies sometimes never respond within the required time frame or they simply can’t come up with the required paperwork.

ULPT: don't want to pay Tinder Gold? here's how you know who liked you,"Some of us have gone through a stage of despair/curiosity when we arrive at Tinder, we believe that it will be a new way to meet people, but surprise, we have a new like but we need to pay a Gold subscription to see who it was. At least I was not willing to pay for something I did not plan to use so often so kinda playing around I found a way to see who liked me and now I'm sharing it with you all  


On top of all, I did it on PC, but I think it can be done on mobile.  


First, you need to log in on tinder in your pc. Once you're in clic on the likes you got. You see blurred pics of who liked you, so now you right-click and press inspect (At least that's how is called in chrome). Now you'll see a HTML-based window of your regular window  


From here you'll need to open the HTML lines pressing  ►   
so, the next steps are opening:  
— Body  
— div id = ""Content""  
— div class = ""app expand""  
— div class = ""app body""  
— div class = ""h""  
— div class = ""h"" (again)  
— div class = ""mobile expand""  
— div class = ""expand bgc""  
— div class = ""likesyou\_scroller""  
— div class = ""pos""  
At this point you'll see a lot of  ► to expand, and every one of them is a blurred picture of who liked you, so the next step is to open the one you want to see and again open div class = ""pos (a) Trs"", and then div class = ""Expand enterAnimationContainer"". Once you get there in the line of div class = ""bdrs"" you'll se a url, copy/paste that url (kinda tricky to do, but it's doable) and you'll see the picture of who liked you.  


So that's all, If you want to match that person only go to the main screen and search for that person,  It's one of the first people you see but not the first photo displayed, so be careful",UnethicalLifeProTips,1569201222,Archaetecture,4,5,True,2019-09-22

ULPT How to brainwash your employees into obligating them to do things they normally wouldn't do if you work at Allstate.,"You see, the hard sell is simply a technique leveraging the commonly  accepted customs in the United States. So, the idea behind it is  ingratiating yourself with the intended victim. You give them something  small and insignificant to you. This simple gesture then guarantees that  they must say ""yes"" when you ask them a favor. In reality, you always  have the right to say ""no."" However, at Allstate, they punish you for  saying ""no"" by setting you up and lying to senior leadership that you  somehow disrespected them by saying ""no."" This is the insidiousness of  the hard sell. They teach their people to use it and they punish all the  lower workers if it doesn't work. So, essentially, they condition them  to accept everything they say at face value, even when they're lying.  This underhanded unethical technique is hammered into the heads of the  employees. They'll ruin your life and your career if you leave, so they  have no worries. Never mind that it is unethical as fuck. Allstate cares  not for civil rights, federal laws, or your personal boundaries. You  see, they foster the social justice warrior mentality. What's even  funnier is that the social justice warriors don't even know they're  being used as the tip of a spear management wields. They don't care  about justice or laws. They care about power and influence which allows  them to ignore federal and local laws.

Instead, next time you want to drink at a concert don’t drain your future child’s college fund. The solution is easy: buy a urine bag, fill 1/2 to 2/3 with alcohol of choice. Vodka or tequila would probably work best, but darker spirits work too

Strap alcohol filled bag to leg and hide with shorts or pants. Or hide the bag in you pocket if the packet/bag size ratio is optimal.

That tube that usually takes ur urine to the bag to save for later, should now be thought of as a straw. Depending on length, you might be able come up through your pants, past your upper body, resting right around the clavicle.  Adjust as needed based on clothing. The straw is supposed to be at your genitalia so you must hide it’s true purpose until safety in your seat.

Security will likely not grope you near the crotch in my experience, but maybe security in your area is a less repressed bunch. If the urine bag is found, embarrassingly take them aside and tell them about your embarrassing medical condition. You wish you could go out and piss like most folks, but your faucet is leaky. If they question the color, it’s related to the condition! or at least that’s what the doc says, and that you’re being humiliated in front of everyone for something you can’t control. Should work 9 of 10 times.

If Paul blart failed mall cop STILL holds firm and does not allow you in with your catheter, offer them to taste the liquid in the bag. You PROMISE it’s your diseased pee!

With the first car, order something small like a single meal, then offer to pay for the person behind you. This is why it’s key to have a compact car between you rather than an SUV, otherwise you might end up paying for an entire family meal anyways.

After that, have the next car order the rest of the food for the group. When the car that was in between you two finds out their meal was paid for, they’ll want to pay it forward too and buy the car behind them’s meals. You can get 4-6 meals for the price of 1-3 this way.

I also have a roach problem. My roommates are not the dirtiest, nor am I. I did a semi-sprinf clean on Momday. However, we still seem to get roaches; the small ones. Could greasy shit be the cause? I'm going to go buy some Boric acid today. But I've noticed something a couple days ago when my roommate started using his oil fryer.

I haven't found any in the food drawer in a while, but am starting to see more of them where the fryer is at. 

Point is, I will also like to call an exterminator, but I worry the landlord will take forever to do anything.

They bark and growl at everything uncontrollably. Cars driving down the road, a knock at the door, or just walking by. It's the worst especially when everyone is trying to sleep and they wake me up and I can only think about how much they get on my nerves.
They pee on everything. You can't let them run around the house without a piss puddle somewhere or in something. On the couch, in shoes, door, or in their cages, anything that looks like it hasn't been peed on. And then they'll go lick each other's piss which is disgusting obviously.
They bite and are violent. They've bitten everyone who lives in the house along with my little 4 y/o nephew who was trying to play with them.
And we've already tried to get rid of them 3 different times. First time they went to a young couple but they were shortly brought back after clawing up and destroying their door and having peed everywhere. The second time the man who took him was bitten by Teddy. The third time idk what happened but probably not too far off first 2.

ULPT: Mask extension of BAT or EXE file as any other,"Let's say you have a batch file named ""**run.bat**"" that opens [fakeupdate.net](https://fakeupdate.net/) on the target computer in Internet Explorer full screen.

i.e.  
start iexplore -k [www.fakeupdate.net/win7/](https://www.fakeupdate.net/win7/)

But I mean who opens batch files? Well using the Unicode Right-to-Left override symbol \[[alt+202e](https://unicode-table.com/en/search/?q=202e)\] we can disguise the file to have a different extension. The RTLO symbol will reverse the order of any characters entered afterwards, in appearance only.

Open command prompt and navigate to the folder of your batch/exe file.

Type **copy run.bat run(alt+202e)cod.bat**

(You can also copy the symbol through here - [https://unicode-table.com/en/search/?q=202e](https://unicode-table.com/en/search/?q=202e) and to paste in cmd prompt, just right click the window header, select edit then paste.)

This will create a duplicate of the file in the same directory, but renamed to runtab.doc

If you wanted to create a duplicate with extension jpg instead, you would replace run(alt+202e)**cod**.bat with run(alt+202e)**gpj**.bat - where cod and gpj are the reversed extensions Doc and Jpg.

For better deception, I would recommend using a name that can help distract from the filename ending extension like 'Guitar**Tab**.doc' or for Exe files I would name the file something like '2019IsraelAnn**exe**.doc' or 'ReportsSeptemberAnn**exe**.doc'.  Though it's only really more important with exe files because reversed it's still exe; if the batch file example above was exe instead i.e. Run.EXE then the output would have been runexe.doc",UnethicalLifeProTips,1568635184,WonCat,4,70,True,2019-09-16

ULPT Request: How to piss off or inconvenience my neighbor?,"Hi all! I recently moved into a row-home in a large(ish) city with two other roommates. Almost every house on our block has a rooftop deck and it's popular to string up lights on top of wood poles mounted in the corners of the deck to use at night when guests are over. So a few weeks ago we did this and all was good for a while. Then last week we received an inspection notice in our mailbox from the city stating that there was a complaint from a neighbor that a ""rooftop structure was altered without proper permit"". This was initially pretty aggravating and I had no interest of taking a day off of work to have an inspector come to my house to approve the four pieces of wood we attached to our deck. So, that night I took the lights down and just laid them over the existing railing. This is where the story gets interesting: As I was taking the lights down, my neighbor two houses down from me asks why I am doing this. I explain the notice we received and he tells me that my neighbor right next to me (old grumpy lady) has been a problem for years and mostly likely contacted the city. 

All is well for the next week or two but then while I was relaxing on my roof I see the neighbor two houses down taking down their lights. I ask why they are doing this and they claim that the mean neighbor broke their bulbs and said that they put glass all over her deck. I was sad that they too would have to take down their lights because of the mean old lady. To make matters worse we received another notice from the city with ""complaints"" about things around our property that don't even exist.

So now I want to get back at her. What can I do to piss her off / inconvenience her? Another idea would be to find a clever way to bait her into doing something illegal (like breaking bulbs) and catching that on camera.

ULPT : How to confirm a suspicion,"A long time ago, we tried to discover our friend's crush. He gave us plenty of hints and we thought we found out who it was (we will call her Maria), but he didn't want to say if it was her or not. He told me as a hint that she wasn't there in his Math class this day. He told me not to ask someone of his class who was absent that day, and I never asked. 

A few months later, I talk to him about this hint and since I was almost sure Maria was his crush, I told him : ""Jake told me who was absent in your math class the other day, it was Maria"". He finally told me that it was indeed his crush. 

There are a few steps to follow to use this LPT, let's say if you want to discover a secret, Jake's secret : 

1. Gather enough hints to almost know the secret. You must be 85% sure that your hints tell you what the secret is.
2. Find someone who knows the secret (we will call him Paul).
3. Go and talk to Jake alone. He mustn't be able to contact Paul.
4. Tell him that Paul revealed the secret to you (and says what you think is the secret).

Normally, they will say ""Fuck he betrayed me"" or something like that, If your hypothesis was false, he will tell you it is false.

I've tried using my computer but it's too much setup, connect, cables dangling around and have to keep the monitor up, access keyboard, and fight with ads and click next link also quality can be bad or missing episodes.

I was paying for a VPN service but that stopped working with the DNS servers I believe.

I'm wondering if there's any smarter way to approach this. I don't mind spending some money on something that would be reliable and work. USB? sticks all ideas welcome.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1568411880,Eblanc88,2,0,True,2019-09-13

ULPT Request: How to “crash”/disable the computer at the gas pump?,"Those of us who live in many parts of the US know of those annoying gas pumps nowadays that have screens built in playing ads and annoying pop-culture news that nobody asked for. Apparently there’s a way to “mute” the audio in some models, but the gas stations don’t put labels on the pump most of the time, so most people don’t even know muting it is an option. On top of this, I’ve noticed that some of these gas pumps actually have the mute option disable completely (none of the 8 buttons on the face of the pump mute it). I got to thinking - maybe if i press enough of the buttons at a time or in a specific order it would cause the computer to crash, or maybe even there is a button combo that will bring the computer to a device settings screen. I just want to mess with the computers so I don’t want to see/hear the ads, and also, screw the gas companies that make us listen to this crap when pumping gas.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1568255744,riffdex,3,4,True,2019-09-11

ULPT Request - Returning Items,"Hi! 

I have been trying to get a weighted blanket for a long time. I finally found one on Facebook Marketplace for $40, usually this brand is around $100. It was stated to be brand new, never removed from the packaging. 

When I picked it up, it looked that way, but when I got home, it had definitely been removed from the packaging, re-rolled back up, and put away. I was told that it was too heavy, which may have been true, but I'm thinking it was used one night, wasn't comfortable, then sold. 

It looks almost exactly how it would look if it were bought off the shelf, so I'm wondering how I might go about returning or exchanging it for a new one. Who will give me the least trouble, question me the least, or just not even bat an eye. 

I have really needed one of these for a long time because I haven't been sleeping well and it's really been effecting my life.

So I do plan on purchasing another one.

First I create a shipping label on the usps website,  download the PDF of the shipping label, use Photoshop to change the date  so that it's a day before the deadline and then ship my documents. Usps  uses a common Arial bold font so it's very easy to change numbers on  the label. As long as it's postmarked before the deadline, most places  like college departments or IRS offices will accept the package after  the deadline. I've never encountered any issue with the usps post office  since the workers don't care or don't check the label thoroughly - they  scan the label and think it's good then toss it in for outgoing  shipments.

ULPT request: fake a health condition that can be detected by blood test or ECG within a week,"Hi all,

I have some symptoms that mean I occasionally (like 1 in 20 times) feel a bit faint, have pins and needles in my arms and heart palpitations when I drive. It comes on gradually so I can always find somewhere to pull over and wait for it to pass, which it always does within 10 minutes, and it never becomes so intense that I can’t drive at all - it’s just a bit unpleasant. I should add that I’m a very safe driver in general, and it’s not panic attack related.

I told my doctor this, and I’m booked in for a blood test and ECG next week. He’s warned me that if a cause can’t be found and treated, he has to tell the DVLA who I think will revoke my license.

This would be catastrophic because my income is based on my ability to drive, and I’m concerned that the tests won’t show anything and I’ll lose my license.

they signed the lease with the old landlord, not me so all that peace and quite and respect I technically did no agree too.

some idea my friends had: 

* Be constantly under construction
* Remodel the rooms to be half closets, Pretty much 300$ of materials can build a huge closet in each room and make it unlivable
* Get a horrible tenant to rent the 3rd unit (i had one guy who has 4 dogs who wanted to rent),
* I can legally say i want to visit by giving 24-hour notice so just keep hanging out in their units 
* Giant spotlights ""to protect"" the house shinning in, draining tenant-paid utility bill

With progressive specifically, you can edit your policy information and profile online and it shows you what the price change would be if u change whatever u change, this allows you to basically go down the list of jobs they have as well as education, to find the lowest combo.


Also, progressive and many other auto insurance companies give students discounts for being a student, and some offer additional discounts if you provide proof of a high GPA (3-3.5+), I can't remembering the specific gpa needed for the discount.

Most companies require proof of GPA but it is extremely easy to phptoshop, I edited my GPA using ms paint.

I’m not for scamming but these fuckers scammed me and I want what I Paid for so I can at least sell a new one. Same manufacturers as apple so idk what I expected. What dumbass puts an air hole directly linked to the battery compartment?? Yeah it has a double protective seal so it won’t drip at the drip hole but I dry it perfectly, put it on and try hitting it, take it off and it’s like I just dumped juice in between the pod and battery every time I take it off. Well I bought a smok novo love it but I lost it the first day bc I’m a retard. Got another and still love it. But how can I get something back from suorin for scamming me outta $200+ between shitty batteries and their roulette pods??

ULPT Request: How to stop neighbor's dog who is part Kool-Aid Man.,"I didn't realize we could ask for ULPT here too.    


My neighbor's dogs have been terrorizing my life and I've been putting up with it for over two years but two days ago was the last straw. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background.  My neighbors had a boxer.  Not a small dog, but not huge either.  This dog tore my wood fence apart by scratching at panels daily till they came loose.  We'd often find her in our yard.  We have little kids and I remember hearing my son screaming in panic because he was playing outside and surprised by the big dog that jumped out from the bushes.  Told the neighbors, and over the course of a year or so we just fixed panels as they got destroyed.  Often I found this dog wandering the streets of our neighborhood alone.  I always rang neighbor's doorbell and told them their dog was loose... again.  This dog is no longer there.  Pretty sure it escaped and ran away.    


Problem is, the new dog who was a puppy a couple years ago is now a gigantic big black dog that looks like a cross between a rott and a pitbull.  This dog doesn't scratch the fence panels, it jumps into the fence and headbutts the panels apart.  So we can't reattach the panels, we have to go to the store and buy new ones because the dog is so big and strong it shatters them.  For two years now this dog destroys our fence and takes gigantic shits in our backyard.  I've tried Frankenstein's technique of using the corpses of fence panels to reinforce new ones.  I've tried talking to the neighbors.  I've tried creating a vinegar spicy thai chili mix in a spray bottle to coat the fence and deter the dog.  I've tried the little sonic scare the dog away device which works kinda, but what it does is just makes the dog charge back home, but that doesn't solve the giant shits it leaves in my yard.  I've called animal control and the police multiple times and they tell me they can't do anything unless the dog is aggressive.  I thought about lying, but I don't want to harm their dog.  He's a sweet dog, just huge, stinky, and destroying my property.

&amp;#x200B;

My breaking point:  Last weekend at around 10pm someone rang my doorbell.  I have one of those video doorbell devices and spoke to the person through my phone.  It was my OTHER neighbor ringing my doorbell looking angry and clearly done with her day.  She said ""Your big black door is in my yard!""  Explained to her that I don't have a big black dog.   
The asshole neighbor's big black dog blasted through my fence on the right, took some giant shits in my yard, and blasted through the fence on the left made out of much thicker wood!  My kids haven't been able to play in our yard for over a year now because I worry the dog will shatter the fence and scare them while they're playing, or that they'll step in some giant pile of dog shit and bring it inside.    


  
Please help.  I've been researching everywhere and can't come up with answers.  Buying some bear urine off amazon hoping that'll work to scare it away from my fence...

She also has a history of refusing to take her prescribed medication because she ""knows better"" than her psychiatrist. 

I was there for the birth, up until a week when I couldn't take the emotional abuse and volatile behavior she was displaying. CPS was called on us because she kept bringing up closed adoption to the staff, of which I am vehemently against because I myself am very stable and can prove in a court of law this and the fact that my family is very supportive of gaining custody of our new daughter. 

The CPS lady has already mentioned to me that she is extremely close to taking the baby away from her due to preexisting mental health issues. 

I fear for the child's safety and the only reason she won't let me keep the child for myself is out of spite. I'm done trying to play by her rules and will do anything possible to have a life with this newborn. She now wants to take my name off the birth certificate, and then try her hand at a closed adoption. I love this sub and am up for any suggestions of what to say to force CPS' hand in this matter, as I'm sure my extended family can then gain custody of the child.

ULPT HELP Legal Ways to Make Someone’s Life a Living Hell,"TL;DR at the bottom 

Trigger wanting for those sensitive to sexual assault.  So backstory a few years ago I was raped by someone I knew. I then found out he had raped two other girls and I knew one of them and we both agreed to talk to the police. When I reported it to the police the “didn’t have enough evidence” to even interview him and closed the case.  They never contacted my friend who had also been raped by him. I appealed the decision saying that they did not sufficiently investigate but they denied my appeal. This guy is living his life, having a great time, and leaving girls broken. Every time he offends, he escalates. I want to LEGALLY make his life a living hell for a few reasons. 1)He’s an asshole and deserves it for raping me. 2) He is escalating and I do not want him to continue to do this to other women. 3) He needs to know that although he is not being prosecuted, that he cannot continue his behavior. Because of all of this I need some ideas on how to LEGALLY make his life miserable.

It’s not a lot but it can add up if you have them often. You could also get them for local homeless people.

ULPT return items purchased online for free flights,"I’ve done this multiple times, not to purposely gain but because I am disorganised in returning purchases and it always works. On a larger scale this could actually result in a free flight or multiple if you’re bothered. 


You need: to be a member of an airline rewards program that earns points through online shopping and also money for the initial purchase that you can live without for a few weeks OR an Afterpay or zippay account or similar if you don’t want to put up the full amount.


For example - to fly from Melbourne to Sydney it it’s around  8000 Qantas or Virgin Velocity points (if you really commit, Qantas is 96000 points from Sydney to New York)


The velocity estore recently gave 10 points per $1 spent at a particular clothing retailer which offers free delivery and free returns within 30 days. 30 days is also the amount of time it takes to receive your rewards points to avoid items that were refunded from gaining points. 


Purchase one item you actually want (optional) and add an extra thousand dollars of purchases (or really there’s no limit). To look less suss, maybe choose a handful of very expensive items of clothing and purchase in 3 different sizes so it shows real intention.


Once received, wait a fortnight and lodge a return for all the items you want a refund for. You will have the return initiated BUT until they receive it the retailer won’t let velocity know to cancel the points. After 30 days, the velocity points move to your account. Once that happens, post the items for your full refund. You now have a free flight.


It’s also helpful that the purchases to earn points don’t have to be in your name, they just want to track the cookies so you could target the same retailer under multiple names and delivery addresses while an extra points promotion is on.


Tip - if it’s not an online only retailer, check that you don’t have to return online purchases in store within 30 days because some do that.

"Request: How do I get revenge on a drug addicted, pervy professor who destroyed my life?","
Long story short. I was in grad school(masters of nursing) had a pervy professor/director who was responsible for getting me kicked out. Bc of his scum bag actions I’m being crushed by student loan debt that l never be able to repay.

He lied to the university about my “poor performance” and gave me a failure that led to my dismissal.

This guy is a straight up scum bag. One day, he touched my face, told me how sexy my dress was and asked me out for drinks. I ignored him, which was a big mistake. After that he went out of his way to make my academic life miserable and subsequently failed me.

This guy originally lost his nursing license bc he was found down, on top of a patient after he overdosed on drugs. I know this bc you can look up any nursing/medical license and see what actions were taken against an individual and why.

He recently got his licenses back after going to rehab and all that bullshit.

How can I make an effective complaint to actually get his nursing license taken away. This is in AZ if it makes a difference.

For those who want to know, I never reported the incident of him hitting on me bc I knew he was fucking crazy and would likely take it out on me. This dude also has other reports of sexual harassment from previous students but it was promptly swept under the rug by the university.

How can I get revenge on this fuck? Ideally I would get his nursing license take away, as he just got it back after having it suspended for years. I am open to all/any revenge.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1567740887,Mrhalothane,1,1,True,2019-09-05

ULPT: Former tow truck driver here [WA US]. Unless the posted tow away sign is from a legit tow company you can park there without worrying about being towed. More inside.,"No matter how official the sign looks (I'm not sure about government property) unless the sign is from a legit RTTO or Registered Tow Truck Operator it's a huge pain in the ass to get you towed. And the process will take days for the most part. This is especially true on public roads with curbside parking. If you need to park for a very brief time and there's an RTTO sign there I'd do it. Because if they call to have you towed but you already left they'll get billed for the tow even though you weren't there. The only fluke would be that they called and a tow truck was in the area. So when they call it's usually When they're positive that they can get you towed. And the RTTO usually has to verify that the person making the call is on the list of authorized people. 

 When I was a garbage man we put these big tow away signs on a row of dumpsters in the middle of the village where parking is really tough. That way we had somewhere to park and do our business after work. Still works to this day.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1567802363,home_cheese,31,44,True,2019-09-06

ULPT: Want paid time off? Already used up all of your vacation days? Try this.,"Some companies have a policy in which if a close relative dies they will not only give you the time off to attend the funeral, but pay you in full for the time taken off (especially retail and warehouse jobs).

To take advantage of this; First, scan your local obituaries for your desired relative. Maybe you enjoy the classic ""my Grandmother died"", maybe you've used that excuse too many times and you need a Grandfather, MAYBE you have dark fantasies of your Aunt Lillian being ran over by a lownmower made of squirrel teeth, we arn't here to judge. Take a picture of the obituary and save it for later.

Next we need to create documentation. Most of the time, your HR department will be too uncomfortable with approaching you for more documentation after you send them a sappy email regarding the time you need off for the funeral, along with a photo (for proof) of your poor Aunt Linda's obituary. If they do however, there are a few ways you can go about producing documentation. The tech savvy of us will use photoshop to create a fake mourning card, or an email from the funeral home ""following up"" on the scheduled time and date for the wake. Others will go a little more head on and find the exact funeral home that is hosting your ""relatives"" wake and call the funeral director....directly. You can usually find this out by looking up the deceased name and date of passing into google, some funeral homes will host the same information on their own site, so when you type the information into google you will most likely get a hit. Next, posing as a relative and asking for ""any documentation""  usually works. A bill of sale, or more likely, a reservation notice, will usually suffice.


After you've acquired the proper documentation send it off to your HR department  (or whoever oversees scheduling) and await your vacation time and paycheck.

I bought used games off of Amazon and sometimes they just wouldn't work. So without question, the seller or Amazon would either give me a refund or another used game.

On every occasion, I'd ask them if I should return it and they ALWAYS respond with, ""no if the game doesn't work, then we'd waste money by paying for shipping so just keep it""

In each class, the bigger ones at least, there will be multiple reading groups with different people in them.

Take those notes, and submit them to another group to gain access to their notes.

You can basically keep doing this throughout the semester and get notes on every reading without ever having to do any reading (again, you might have to do one for initial access).

I did this for boring courses or courses with stupid amounts of reading and never got caught. Usually, you can see who's in the group, so if you recognize a name from another one of your groups just make sure to avoid posting notes that that person might recognize.

ULPT Request: how to not let a roommate move into your dorm room?,"So here's the thing. 

I just moved into my dorm room in a students' dormitory that I lived in last year. The dorm's location and equipment are fantastic. Everything I've ever asked for. 

My last year's roommate was amazing, my man is a homosexual PhD student, so he's been traveling Europe using his boyfriend's money. In other words, I had the room all for myself and it gave me unimaginable freedom, like working out first time in the morning, and bringing my girlfriend in whenever I felt like. 

This year, however, my sweet roommate is relocated someplace else. So they're most likely bringing someone else. 

There are already a few potential roommates and I've met all of them. They're fucking annoying. I know them from uni. 

I tried asking the dorm manager if I could live alone this year and he said fuck no. 

So from here, I have a few ideas that are unethical and might not work. 

1. Claim that my roommate from last year is coming sometime soon and let all the potential roommates know about it. 
 
I wish I could do this. But the dorm manager is a slimy son of a bitch and won't give 2 fucks if the spot of my room says ""available"" on the chart

2. The room is so fucking small. In it there are 2 closets, 2 beds, one fridge, one nightstand, and ONE TABLE. 

I've already claimed the table and the nightstand for myself. So when the roommie comes in, whoopsie, he won't have a table. With the fridge inside, it's actually fucking impossible to rearrange the room and make it fit another table. So this argument is under development, and I don't know how I can use it to scare the roommie away. 

Besides these 2, I really have no fucking clue how to proceed.

Ulpt: get free or cheap food from CFA,"I’m a disgruntled employee at cfa and thought to myself what better way to get back at them then posting tips on how to beat them. These are just tips that I learned from working there. Will be taking down in a couple of days

For customers:
Cfa overcharges for salads significantly, like stupif amount. They don’t however overcharge for pieces of the salad. Ask the person to ring you up for 3 pieces of lettuce(.15 each) and 2 sides of tomatoes slices (.15 cents) and ask them for SHREDDED cheese (should be free) and for grilled nuggets if you want grilled chicken. Or a breaded filet for breaded chicken. Ta da salad for less than half of the price.

Go through the drive thru and order a meal, then when you get up to the window tell them you told them you want a large, most times the manager there is not paid enough to care so they just upgrade it for free.

Want a nuggets meal? Don’t get the number 3 instead get a kids meal and ask for a side of extra nugget, and for them to upgrade the drink to a medium (or don’t look at the tip below.) and then you can trade the toy for ice cream, the downside of this is that you do get small fries and you can’t upgrade, still worth it tho. 

If you ever get a meal and want lemonade (they charge you 30 cents extra!), get it small size(then it’s free) with lite ice. You will get about the same amount of lemonade if you get a medium with regular ice. 

Do you have an angel tickets, go the NEXT day and tell them you want to use it. When they ask for it, tell them you actually want to keep it for your kid or some bs story, if it’s a team member not a shift leader and they don’t care they’ll most likely let you keep it. Then go to another branch and do the same. ( this works for anything like the tickets, such as the choc walk)

For employees:

Does your branch of cfa treat you badly, does not give you benefits? Screw them. (If you do get caught most likely you will get fired, do at your own risk)

A customer make a big order and didn’t scan their app, take a duplicate receipt, wait a day then try to redeem the point through the link on the receipt. This id easily abused so be careful. Do it with an alternate email and make sure your name is not mentioned anywhere, and DON’T ABUSE corporate will catch you and fire you. (~7 people got fired for abusing this)

A customer gives you an angel ticket, unless your branch counts them or something, keep the tickets and go to another branch after your shift, make sure it’s the same day and then you get free sandwiches (works for similar stuff.)
Also, this is a bit more risky so do it at your own peril. If a card scans the offer card for something free, take it pretend you scan it and actually promo it out and keep the card.

It is for fast pass users as they have a set limit on how many times you can use it per theme park ...I have used it at other parks outside of Disney  such as sixflags so check out wherever you go to spread the joy! 

Every long line in Disney theme parks after you enjoy the ride...  run back to the entrance area or section where employees are and look exhausted (from running around supposedly) but also in a complete state of panic.

Claim you or your friend or family member has misplaced serious medication and have already been in line waiting practically by the entrance of the ride itself. State that you left it somewhere relatively close either before you quick departure and return or right when you waltz back up.

They will:
-give you a fast pass re-entry to AT LEAST the ride you just enjoyed if not, sections of the park, and for a party of 3 to 5 (whichever you want to pick) 

-keep in mind this works outside of theme parks that don't have fast passes or limit per day ones...you can simply bypass lines stating you went all the way through it and had to leave 

Repeat at every ride you go on and you have just made your limited fast pass become a fucking god mode pass

Invest in a waterproof mattress cover, maybe a good topper for extra security, and get yourself a new mattress 3-4 times a year.

They donate the returns to charity, so that shaves off a bit of the unethical side.

Bonus tip: They'll try to send you a free topper of their brand and extend your trial by about a month when you do the return request.

Just don't damage or stain the mattress - hence the waterproof cover. Bad idea for pet-owners.

I'd have no problem keeping our dog (Bear) in a kennel, but he is a little 15 yr old yorkie that is 90% blind, deaf, and needs to be let out every 3-4 hours. My ruthless Korean mom says that we should just put him down, but Bear isn't suffering or in pain. He just needs a little extra care and attention. Unfortunately I wasn't granted ALL of the days off from work I needed to watch him until my parents come back and nobody has a flexible schedule that can watch him, so I need to fake a doctors note that will say I cannot work for around 13 days. If it helps, I broke my arm last fall and cleared to work in January, but still went to physical therapy up until a month ago. Maybe I can use that as an excuse by saying I hurt it somehow? I'm not entirely sure as I'm usually a ""by the book"" person so I've never done this before. Any tips or advice is appreciated.

And since reddit loves doggies, here is a picture of Bear before he got really old.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1567293933,RyanG7,6,5,True,2019-08-31

Organize a garage sale and say the proceeds are to charity but just keep the money and save on taxes,"TL/DR @ bottom

Getting rid of old shit can pile up, but also sometimes it's not enough for a garage sale. Take the old stuff you can sell and ask other people like neighbors and friends and all for their old stuff because you'll dispose of it. Give them a few days or a week to get the stuff to you and have a garage sale. You can tell the people that whatever money you give them will go to charity. 

Have the garage sale. Preferably on Saturday morning because most people come then. You can tell them it's for charity, but they probably won't believe you. You can let them know by writing ""Charity Sale"" on the signs. 

After the sale, lots of things won't get sold. Now you save money. Itll be tough work but take the remaining stuff to a Goodwill or some charity place. They give you a receipt thing, I forget what it's called, but you quote what you gave and some approximate numbers (gotta make them low because old but the sheer number of stuff will make up for it) and then you can use it as a write-off for your taxes. 

TL/DR: Tell neighbors and friends you're having a charity sale (garage sale for charity) and they'll give you stuff. Sell the stuff and make some money. Afterwards, take all the stuff that didn't sell and give it to a charity store like GoodWill and claim a write-off for your taxes.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1567145072,gh8lkdshds,1,1,True,2019-08-30

ULPT Request: where can I park some money for a while so the IRS can’t seize it to pay back taxes?,"Just to be clear, this may be unethical but I’m not looking to do anything illegal.

Anyway. I recently came into a settlement that gives me a nice little rainy day cushion but wouldn’t make a dent in the tax situation. Right now IRS keeps seizing anything I put into the bank.

During the interview i told them the company relocated to a city a few hours away (that's why i ""quit""), so my story aligns with the out of service phone number.

He has two kids (age 6-8, I guess) who are playing in the house and you can hear them running all the time, but none of us care about that since they are kids and that's what they do.

ULPT Phone company limiting your video steaming to SD? Use a VPN to steam in 4K for free!,"I just bought a new phone, which ended up kicking me off my old grandfathered unlimited plan that had no restrictions. I chose the cheapest unlimited plan they had, but they wanted an extra $15 PER LINE for me to use mobile hotspot and stream video at any resolution over 480p! After using it, non YouTube, at least, it was actually being limited to 360p! I was really annoyed by this. Sure, you probably don’t need to be steaming 4K in your phone, but especially on a phone like my Note 10plus, 480p is noticeably less sharp than 1080p and above. I found out kinda by accident even I had my VPN turned on, it took off the video resolution restriction (at-least on YouTube and Netflix). So that solved at-least my issue with limited resolution streaming (still working on hotspot), but I’m calling it a win in the war on phone companies raising prices and taking away features only to make you buy them back. Just another reason to have a VPN!

Also side note, having a VPN is smart anyways because at-least the phone company I used to work at (and I assume every other ISP) is actively monitoring your internet usage and history and selling it to advertisers.

For expensive hospital bills (if you have bad insurance) ask if there’s a discount they offer folks with no insurance. Be pushy that you always pay off your debts but you can’t see a realistic way to pay the bill and they’ll likely knockoff 20% or more.,"I just got off the phone with a local hospital after getting an ER bill for $3,900. I have terrible insurance which covered $400 and stuck me with $3,500 to pay for a 3 hour visit with no procedures performed aside some diagnostics. 

When I called, I insisted that I am a person who always does their best to pay off their debts and understand the hospital needs to be paid to stay in business. I then said that although I try to pay my debts, I don’t see any realistic way I’ll be able to pay this bill. I then asked if she could take a look at it so she can acknowledge my insurance covered far less than what I owe. 

She offered an interest free 12-month payment plan. Not gonna fly.

I came back and asked if there was a discount the hospital provides to folks without insurance to which she said there was. I then asked if it’s possible for my bill to reflect a similar discount as my insurance is just horrible.

She then replied she could take 20% off the top.

Although I still owe a mountain of cash, it’s $700 less than what I was preparing to pay. 

Even though I’ve been saving for this and can pay the bill, it infuriates me my fees were prorated at a higher rate simply because I had some sort of insurance and I refused to pay that.

"ULPT: Since YouTube advertisements are becoming longer and longer with fewer options to manually skip them, you can actually fast forward, without any external program by using a console command in Chrome.","1. While in your browser, open the console by pressing Ctrl + Shift + J
2. Type (or paste) in `document.getElementsByTagName(""video"")[0].playbackRate = 1`
3. The digit at the end will determine the speed at which the clip will play, so if you want to fast forward, just change it to 10
4. When the advertisement is over, you can immediately execute the command again, but return the last digit to a 1

Unlike the fast forward feature included in YouTube itself, this is available to use at any time. I have personally only been able to try this out in Chrome, but if anyone else is using a different OS or browser, something similar would *most likely* be possible, since this primarily appears to be a matter of how YouTube works. I figure this could be a useful tip to know, especially since YouTube has a trend to gradually increase the time and amount of advertisements shown.

The bottom line is that this can be used whenever you want, and thus serves as an excellent option to skip advertisements, without needing to install some sort of AdBlock or other suspicious program.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1566792517,fr15287,12,31,True,2019-08-26

I always chose a store that wasn’t polished or had just undergone a change (being bought, renovation, etc.). What i would do is place a temporary block on my debit card through the app, then enter the store and casually check a few items out before choosing a snack and a drink. I’d get in line and go to pay with my card, which would not work, however it won’t say low funds or chip issue, it would always give a generic error. I’d ask what’s the problem and the cashier would always say oh somethings wrong with the card reader, and i would say i don’t have any cash. If you luck out they’ll just say take it, but if not then they’ll apologize and not suspect anything, so they won’t think you’re stealing. 

This WONT work with a credit card and it probably won’t work most of the time. I did this over three years with about 30% success.

He came up to my window and asked me what I was doing and who I was, after I made up a story to avoid getting heat, he asked me why my car smelled like weed. I kind of just blurted out ""I am a smoker."" He took a few seconds to think about it and responded with ""Okay, next time make sure to go through the front office."" and proceeded to let me go.

ULPT: Get Paid Apps For Free," 

Step 1: Set up a second Google account if you don't already have one

Step 2: Go to the Play Store

Step 3: Open the menu from the left side of the screen

Step 4: Go to ""Account --&gt; Family"" and set up a family library

Step 5: Add your other account to the family library

Step 6: Go to ""Account --&gt; Family --&gt; Family Library Settings""

Step 7: Make sure it's set to automatically add purchased apps to the Family Library

Step 8: Use an app like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsfree.android&amp;hl=en_US)

Step 9: Check the app often and find some apps you might want

Step 10: Click on the desired app and it will take you to it in the Play Store

Step 11: Make sure it says the app is on sale for $0.00 and click install

Step 12: Make sure you see the ""Family Library"" slider on

Congratulations! You now have an app that usually costs money for free. You can immediately cancel the install or uninstall the app whenever and it will stay in the family library for free if you want to download it again in the future. As a bonus, if a friend or family member wants an app that's no longer on sale but you have it, add them to the family library so they can get it for free and then you can have them leave/remove them from the family library if you want. Even better, if they then set up a family library after leaving yours, any apps that they clicked the install button on from your library will then be added to the new library and the chain can keep going. Do note that you can only be in one Family Library at a time though. Also, I know there are things you can do with .APK files and stuff but this is easier for the average person and you can quickly share the apps with others this way. I hope this helps some of you! ^(Also, Android Master Race!)

If you want an extra side but don’t want to pay for it, just tell them that they forgot to give it to you. Let’s say that you ordered a giant feast from kfc and you want an extra fries but you’d rather not pay for it, wait until they give you your food, take it away to somewhere where they can’t see you and take out one or two boxes of fries, hide them and then go to the counter and tell them that they forgot to give them to you. As someone who has worked at various different fast food restaurants, I can tell you that we rarely ever check to make sure your telling the truth and we usually just give you the extra food, no questions asked, you can’t make it too obvious though, only ever tell them that they forgot 1-2 things, depending on the size of your order. I’ve done this multiple times and I’ve even gotten away with getting an extra 18 nuggets for free before.

ULPT you can easily get a “bully breed” registered as an ESA and you can’t be denied housing for having them.,"If you own a pit bull or any other “bully breed” but are having a hard time finding a rental property to allow them you can go online and have them registered as an emotional support animal. It costs about 50 bucks to register them. A therapist will call you within a few days and all you have to say is that you have anxiety and the dog helps calm you down or something like that. They email you a dr. note saying you need the dog and they mail you the dogs certificate. Under federal law they can’t deny your dog because of its breed. They also can’t charge you any pet deposits/pet rent. I have ptsd and my dog always helps me with flashbacks, but I know a lot of people who have pit bulls as pets that have a hard time finding somewhere that will take them, or they would like to adopt a pit bull but are concerned they would be denied housing because of it. Your dog does not need any kind of training to be an emotional support animal, the owner just has to state a need for it. You also do not need to have a diagnosed mental illness to qualify. 

This is where I registered my dog and have not had any issues being accepted. Hope this helps!

I want them to be so anonymous, that even if this post is traced back to me, it shouldn't matter.

Here's what I've got. I can use TOR to use the accounts, but first problem is that creating accounts requires solving a recaptcha that can't be done safely via TOR. So, I have to find a public pc without any tracking (safety cameras etc) to create the accounts. Troublesome. 

All the places that require sms verification, I've again found a number of websites that provide fake sms, but GMAIL/Yahoo seem to have blocked these phone numbers already. Is there a way to obtain legitimate numbers without being tracked at all?

Couple of fake-email services online. But using most of them requires recaptcha, which again TOR cannot do. Again trouble.

ULPT Request: Finding the frequency of radio speakers in a classroom,"It's small, it's petty, but I'm trying it anyway. 
 
here's the situation: 
One of my classes right now has assigned seating. not terrible, but ok. 
The problem is that my seat is right below the speaker, which is constantly playing low volume static. You can barely hear it. It's maddening.
I've asked my professor to switch seats, he refused. I told him about the static, but he can't hear it and now thinks I'm just making something up. 
 
What I want to do is somehow find what frequency the speakers listen on, and broadcast silence while class is in session. I'm at least mostly sure it's radio because of the static (last semester the professor in here used a lav mic, though I really have no idea whether that's relevant) 
 
I don't think the university would be too keen on me using their class speakers, but I just want to shut these ones up. I doubt anyone would notice anyway.
 
tl;dr:
 How do I:
A: locate the frequency a set of classroom PA speakers listen on, and
B: subsequently either turn them off or make them play something quieter than static?",UnethicalLifeProTips,1566589536,nogoodthrowawayjokes,8,9,True,2019-08-23

I work in advertising and I have the skills and knowledge to run a blog. This is all an experiment to see if I can make it profitable and how far I can take this this.

1. Friend at a large college

3. Every database is different so is the access,you may or may not be given the URL or IP
4. Gather a LIST of IP's, have friend connect multiple times write your assigned IP down each time.
5. Don't forget if they require access codes/logins get that too
6. Get on whatever device &amp; mask your IP from list
7. Now attempt to connect

\*\*\*don't give up if you don't get it on the first try. There can be many reason why it didn't work BUT it's usually an easy fix... Try another IP from the list. Remember the library is accessing the database from an outside source so in conjuction to the access codes and/or logins they want to verify you're at the physical location\*\*\*

ULPTR: How can I get a coworker fired?,"This woman is a snake. She has taken other people’s jobs in the past and now she is taking my coworkers job who I adore. The coworker I want fired, I’ll refer to as the snitch. 

The snitch has been reporting everything we say or do to our manager (she’s not even in our department). She has been being secretly trained by our manager to take over my coworkers job duties without anyone knowing, but of course we figured it out. They think we are too stupid to figure it out. 

My coworker started as a temp that was supposed to move to perm. Idk why my company started hiring all these temp workers.. but for now me and the snitch are the only real company employees. My coworker does very well at her job, no complaints there. My bitch ass manager (also working on getting her fired, reports were filed with the EEOC by other employees) even has a hard time finding things with her to complain about. 

Our manager is a psychotic micromanager who is very insecure and doesn’t trust any of her employees. She doesn’t like any of us because we see through her constant lies and bullying. The snitch has been walking and working by us for WEEKS knowing she is stealing someone’s job and hasn’t said a damn thing. Our manager has been working with us for WEEKS knowing she never had any intentions of making my coworkers position permanent. 

My coworker noticed temps in other departments getting hired on and asked our manager who said “it’s going to be posted internally because other people may want to apply”. “Other people” is code for the snitch. And like I said, they’ve been planning this and working together for months. HR also confirmed today that they had gotten transfer paperwork weeks ago for the snitch. 

The snitch routinely: 

-disappears for an hour in the morning to talk to her friends 

-takes 2 hour lunches 

-stays late on purpose to mooch overtime from the company 

-constantly gossips but then acts innocent in person

Is there anything I can do to get this snake fired? When my best friend was working at the same company as me, the snitch tried to take her job too. We don’t know what her problem is, all I know is that we all want her ass gone. Her and my manager. Neither of them belong in any sort of leadership positions. Trash.

“Federal tax, social security tax, state tax, etc” and then next to each it will say how much was deducted for each? That’s what I need help with.

I don't mind causing damage to the house for its legal valuation, because I can fix it later. I don't care what the house looks like while I'm in it, if it means I can keep it.

I can really only afford £60k-£70k and even that is painful, as this person has already previously screwed me out of £70k+

ULPT Request: How do I fuck with my immediate boss?,"So I'm 24 and work in the office where I have got multiple bosses. There is this fucker(Let's call him Kim) who recently started screwing me up. I have been learning how to take care of taxes(of the company, as of now he does it alone). He hasn't taught me a thing in last four months(I've been working here since January). Then, he was interviewing candidates for a post of a accountant(she'd be my colleague) but he couldn't find a capable girl(as the ones they found for their budget sucked and all the good ones asked for more money, business is still growing and they already have 4-5 accountants including me). Then he asked me to. I did find a girl, she's quite smart and has a master degree in finance. She looks great too( and we have great bonding, if she weren't dating someone we'd perhaps be discussing the same by now.. I taught her everything in a couple of weeks and I learned that in 6-7 months). Now Kim is giving me shit. He will teach her everything giving her adequate time. She got flexible hours. She leaves at sharp 6.30 while we have to be here unless we're done with the day(usually 8pm if I am lucky, sometimes 8.30 or in a few cases 9 pm). Another thing, I get paid more than my fellow accountants, and she's being paid as much as me. In July, I got a raise(say $300), but August's salary was lesser. When I asked Kim for an explanation he said it was effective from May, and not june, so the raise was $150. Now I am furious as this man is making my life hell. We got different cabins. A front end office, my cabin and another newly constructed cabin upstairs. Kim, makes her sit upstairs while when he's not here, she will sit with me. 

The thing is if I tell my boss(not Kim) that I quit today, he'll be fucked. They have invested their time in me and I have given them output. They are happy with my performance and a few things I handle by my own. I even work from home sometimes. I don't have a problem with her getting paid as much as me, but the thing is the fucker Kim did it on purpose. He has great command over accounts and has been taking care of their business as well as personal accounting(more of a family accountant lol). So, I want to do something that will take that motherfucker back to ground, he's become over-confident with his knowledge and power. Reality is I can beat him provided that I am taught abut how shit is done. That he won't do. 

I got his work and personal e-mail(not passwords, it sends an otp to his number to change password). His phone number. How can I screw him over? He's 32 btw.

ULPT Request: How do I fuck with my immediate boss?," So I'm 24 and work in the office where I have got multiple bosses. There is this fucker(Let's call him Kim) who recently started screwing me up. I have been learning how to take care of taxes(of the company, as of now he does it alone). He hasn't taught me a thing in last four months(I've been working here since January). Then, he was interviewing candidates for a post of a accountant(she'd be my colleague) but he couldn't find a capable girl(as the ones they found for their budget sucked and all the good ones asked for more money, business is still growing and they already have 4-5 accountants including me). Then he asked me to. I did find a girl, she's quite smart and has a master degree in finance. She looks great too( and we have great bonding, if she weren't dating someone we'd perhaps be discussing the same by now.. I taught her everything in a couple of weeks and I learned that in 6-7 months). Now Kim is giving me shit. He will teach her everything giving her adequate time. She got flexible hours. She leaves at sharp 6.30 while we have to be here unless we're done with the day(usually 8pm if I am lucky, sometimes 8.30 or in a few cases 9 pm). Another thing, I get paid more than my fellow accountants, and she's being paid as much as me. In July, I got a raise(say $300), but August's salary was lesser. When I asked Kim for an explanation he said it was effective from May, and not june, so the raise was $150. Now I am furious as this man is making my life hell. We got different cabins. A front end office, my cabin and another newly constructed cabin upstairs. Kim, makes her sit upstairs while when he's not here, she will sit with me.

The thing is if I tell my boss(not Kim) that I quit today, he'll be fucked. They have invested their time in me and I have given them output. They are happy with my performance and a few things I handle by my own. I even work from home sometimes. I don't have a problem with her getting paid as much as me, but the thing is the fucker Kim did it on purpose. He has great command over accounts and has been taking care of their business as well as personal accounting(more of a family accountant lol). So, I want to do something that will take that motherfucker back to ground, he's become over-confident with his knowledge and power. Reality is I can beat him provided that I am taught abut how shit is done. That he won't do.

I got his work and personal e-mail(not passwords, it sends an otp to his number to change password). His phone number. How can I screw him over? He's 32 btw.

TL;DR- My immediate boss won't stop screwing with me and won't let me go ahead, how do I fuck him up with the little info I got about him?( Go as unethical as you want, because fuck Kim!)",UnethicalLifeProTips,1566396015,noteprocupes,4,1,True,2019-08-21

College parking,"So I used to do this when I went to college. It’s dependent on one of those parking structures where you pay before you park and put a receipt in the window, no pay-as-you-leave with the yellow bar that raises to allow you out.

The ticket machines had the option of paying cheap for something like an hour or paying more for several hours (or paying a ridiculous amount for a sticker for one semester at a time, which also doesn’t cover parking from like 8pm to 6am).

What I would do is buy the cheapest available, put it in my windshield, and make sure I always parked in a spot with either really high-traffic nose-to-nose parking or (preferably) inside up against a wall. NEVER back in. The security that trolled the parking lot very rarely took the time to get out, squeeze in, and check the time on the receipt.

With that method, I would generally get ticketed 1-3 times a semester. I don’t remember the exact numbers anymore, but basically I would pay over one semester about half the cost of an actual parking pass.

Also, once every couple of months (if the receipt starts to fade in the sun) get another $5-ish hour parking receipt.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1566268678,HMWWaWChChIaWChCChW,1,1,True,2019-08-19

ULPT Request: Brick Surface Pro to get warranty,"So basically according to the whole Microsoft Surface Pro community, the chances of your Surface Pro breaking right after the end of you warranty is unreasonably high.

According to German and Austria law, you have 2 years of warranty. This is not the same as the normal warranty, but something guranteed by law. However, in order to return something, it has to be a defect that has been there when you bought it, or originated from poor manufacturing (touchscreen issues, dead pixels,...)

Is there a way to brick my own surface pro so that they give me a refurbished one (which then again has 2 years warranty), without them getting suspicous? 

I'm thinking about using one of those USB killers.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I don't want to do this just because I want a new device. I'm happy with the current one. I'm doing this because so many people said that problems arise right after the end of a two year warranty and if that happens I can't afford a new one at the moment.

I'm a pretty guiet person and I tend to avoid confrontation, but I can't really raise my voice or yell without sounding really angry (having a lot of pent up anger also doesn't help). But anyway, I yelled the first thing that came to my head which was ""Oi! Fuck off you little cunts!"" They ran off after that. The second time I'd just got home from work and looked out the back window and saw two kids with my flatmate's puppy's toy walking down the alley. They looked inside and we made eye contact. I didn't see, but they dropped the toy just outside of the alley so I couldn't see it when I went to look for it. My flatmate got home just after and went out to ask the kids if they knew who took the toy. They basically said it was the other kids and we found it afterwards. But today we were out the front moving in a new couch and a few of them came over and started harassing us and the puppy. They also jumped the front fence and we're climbing in out tree until I told them to get out.
Sorry for the long post but my flatmate and I dunno how to deal with them and we're hoping to find some ways to fuck with them or get back.

ULPT Request: My parents are completely batshit and unreasonable. I need to get them so involved with something else they’ll leave me alone.,"A bit of context:


I was just about a poster child growing up. I got straight A’s for as long as I can remember, I’m musical, and I don’t go out partying and drinking. I don’t even play video games. However, despite all human effort my parents are making my life a living hell.


I started college a couple semesters ago, but things went to shit pretty quickly. I attended all my classes, I tried as hard as I absolutely could but I’ve been having some very serious attention problems. The professor could be talking for 15 minutes about my favorite subject but it all sounded like White Noise to me. For this reason, I also can’t hold a job. Obviously, for me, getting this fixed is the number one priority.


My parents, however, are not helpful. I would say the last 12 months have been spent as a perennial screaming match. Now I know this sounds like the Rick and Morty copypasta but the causes tend to be very subtle. They don’t get it. They say they want to reach compromises but they’re unworkable because they veer too far in their direction and I just can’t meet them.


Now here’s the kicker. I’m an only child, so there are no other kids for them to be preoccupied with. They’ve also been taking marriage counseling so they get along better. Normally this would be a good thing but now it means they can be fatally wrong TOGETHER and I have absolutely nowhere to go. Reason isn’t possible, so I have to get them fixed on something else.

So yeah, they ripped me off. I cashapp’d them $45 for 2 carts. They sent me photos of everything during the process and I explained to him my reluctance to do it because of the possibility of getting ripped off and that I use the carts for my anxiety and chronic pain, instead of using meds.

He seemed real cool and kept in touch the first day or 2 after shipping them out and yesterday morning I messaged him on Snapchat and asked if he 1) got the tracking number yet and 2) if they would arrive soon because it had been about 3 days since he sent them. I go to check my messages today and the message was opened and he removed me as a friend so I cannot contact him.

I requested my $45 on cashapp and told him that’s really not cool and couldn’t say much more than that cause of the character limit. 

So I have his cashapp and I have his Snapchat. I’d like to teach him a lesson or at least make his online life hell for the next little bit.

1. Order any dye off of overtone.com
2. If it comes leaked, send the customer service a photo of the leaked dye (or just wipe some on the seal and bottle and it works the same)
3. They will offer you a replacement of any bottles that are “damaged” (loose term for them)
4. Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 with the replacement bottles they send
5. They will offer you more bottles or another refund, either do the same or receive a full refund on your order!

I didn’t necessarily do this unethically at first, I ordered a few bottles of dye, one arrived leaked. I sent photos to customer service and received another bottle of the dye in the mail less than a week later. This bottle also arrived leaked, so I sent another photo to the same customer service rep and expressed my “extreme disappointment” at the quality of arrival for the product.

Those that would use these ""tricks"" usually already know them so its hopefully going to be informative to those on the inside of the ""locked"" doors. Non security management and users should pay extra attention. 

Pad locks are garbage. They can be picked very easily. With 60 seconds of instruction and $5 tools, you too can learn to defeat the lock holding close bike chains, filing cabinets and the dump on the far side of the sand lot. Defense measures can be added to combat trickery such as anti-pick pins, but even that falls short when force is used to simply break the lock as they are suprisingly fragile. There are good locks out there. Namely the round type that turn to lock. They should have some sort of picking countermeasure, but that can get pricy. 

Things about pad locks apply to door locks as well. Easy to finagle. The commercial type you find on every shop front can even be brute forced. Vice grips and some torque will open up just about every one. Google it. 

Keyed locks have vulnerablitities so lets use magnetic locks, yeah? Sure, why not. They use a powerful electromagnetic strip usualy located at the top of a door frame. When supplied with power they hold the door shut. They're usually controlled by a card key system or punch pad of some sort. Mag-locks have two main weaknesses, they need power and they have to allow people to escape through them.

Why should you do this?  Your city libraries ebook and audio book collections are only so big. And sometimes, your system will have books 4-6 or a series, but lack 1-3. Sharing this info allows us to view completely collections that we otherwise couldn’t. To be slightly more ethical, use your local library when you can, but fill in the gaps with your friends when you can. And be respectful of their cards!

I said ""the package never came even though the tracking number said it delivered"". The seller said to file a claim through USPS instead.

I didn't file a claim to USPS and was gonna tell the 3rd party seller that I got the package if he contacted me again.

ULPT REQUEST: Can i just not pay my speeding ticket?,"Recently i was on vacation in the US where me and my friend were road tripping through a bunch of different states. We are both European and rented the car in Boston. So we were driving through Louisiana and a sneaky cop pulled me over in a 50 zone (going 62) that was in between two different 65 zones, because i forgot to slow down. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with tickets, possibly in a foreign country, and if i can just get away with not paying the ticket (which was more expensive online than the state law suggested)?. Would i not be able to ever return to the US without being arrested, is it a state only thing (wouldn't mind never going to La again) or would they just drop it because it would be too much work?

ULPT: Use Chrome's location sensor to find Tinder &amp; Bumble matches out of your area.,"I don't know if this has been posted, but a fairly lazy search of ULPTs suggested it hasn't. Tinder has passport, which is a paid feature that lets you scope out matches in different cities/counties/states/countries, whereas Bumble relies on your current location for matches, but you can move around like the shadowy Jason Bourne of dating from Chrome on a desktop/laptop:

Login to Tinder or Bumble's web app and wait for things to load up. Once you're in, start looking for matches. Hell, swipe a couple if you like the look of 'em. Allow location access if prompted.

Open the Inspector (Ctrl, Shift, I on Windows, likely Cmd, Shift, I on Mac) and then hit the three stacked dots in the upper-right of the console window and select More Tools &gt; Sensors. One of those sensors is Geolocation, and it has an override feature with some canned locations like London, Mountain View, San Francisco etc plumbed in.

Click Manage and add your own custom locations, such as the place you work, or somewhere you're going on holiday. Use [LatLong.net](https://LatLong.net) to convert addresses (postal/zip codes or place names) to a latitude and longitude that Chrome will accept, e.g 37.386052 lat, -122.083851 long; it's crucial to have 6 digits after the decimal point on both, so if your either lat or long is something like ""12.345600"" tweak the last digit to a 1, it'll put you maybe a few metres out from where you want to be. Save that location, and you're away.

Sometimes it takes a couple of refreshes, but as soon as you start seeing guys and girls in a different location, you're away. Bumble is great for this as it gives an approximate location, like Bob, 28, New York City. If you stuck the coordinates for Central Park in, you just traveled from the comfort of your armchair in Boise.

"ULPT Request: Pets in Apartment w/o Deposit/Inspection [Canada, BC]","Hello friends,

Question for the more clever than I amongst you. 

A little backstory,

I live in Canada, BC. We live in an apartment that allows pets. I however, moved in without pets and thus would need an inspection and $500 deposit to get pet(s). My landlord sucks and is immensely lazy/bad at her job (also hates me) so getting her to do anything even remotely to do with her landlord duties is like pulling teeth. The reason she hates me is because she tried to screw me over a mailbox key and out of principle I went to the tenancy board about it. Which resulted in the parent company (her boss) eating a $350 fine and her having to supply the key she wanted me to pay for.

That being said,

My fiance and I have been wanting to get a couple cats (2). At work today my co-worker told me she's got some kittens that fit the bill for what we've been looking for. 

Is there some methodology to getting around my useless landlord that wouldn't get me evicted? My coworker suggested that if I ever got caught just say I'm pet sitting. But I cannot quite get around the longevity of that excuse if I got caught more than once. Especially since cats like windows and landlords can see said windows. Ideal situation is to just avoid landlord entirely and thus the $500 as well.

Thanks in advance for the good and bad advice lol.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1565715504,Gregolo,3,1,True,2019-08-13

There was a big football game going on that weekend and they were super busy I guess. The guy who was checking receipts had to be in his mid-late sixties.

ULPT: If you have a job where you are left alone but your supervisor can pop in at any minute to check up on you..... use a hidden motion detecting alert device to let you know when he is coming.,"When I worked night security for a security agency I used two different kinds of devices to tell me when my supervisor was coming to do a surprise check on me to make sure I was alert (not sleeping or goofing off). 

Well, joke was on him because depending on what device I used I got  an advance warning of his arrival and he knew nothing about it.

And it worked great! 

The two devices I used: one of those simple (and cheap... less than $20) doorway alert devices that a lot of small shops use to alert them when a customer comes in. It makes a sound or lights up (you can choose which). It has a motion detecting module you place somewhere where someone will come though. And a base unit you place next  yo you. 

The other device is kind of expensive (cost me $100 with a $50 discount) but IMO is worth it. It is a driveway alert device designed to send a signal 1/4th of a mile away. 

I used both at one place I worked at. One I magnetic-mounted to a guardrail next to the driveway. The other I plugged into an overhead (up on the wall) electrical wall outlet in the foyer of the building. 

And you can get multiple sensors in case you need to monitor several entrances.

"In an argument or conflict, don't apologize too early even if you intend to apologize for something","When in an argument with someone like a spouse or close family member, bestfriend, and you are 'both' at fault for some-things, don't apologize too early.

The goal of the argument for any sane person is to get through it and work things out. But apologizing too early works against the goal, because it leaves you with no leverage, and leaves you with no 'positive action' to take later on. How many times are you in an argument and you say, ""I already apologized for that' etc. etc.

I've had rare but intense arguments with my wife over our 12 year marriage, and we always work it out, but it takes longer if I apologize upfront. She ends up still wanting to vent about things that I have apologized for and then I am upset that she is not responding to my apology in a way that makes sense. So it makes things worse.

The trick is to know that you are going to apologize for something but act like you won't at first. Don't specifically say you won't, just resist at first and let the conversation continue into deeper issues. Then at the right time, time the apology when your partner shows signs of weakness or being emotionally overwhelmed. You have to be strong for this to work. Then the apology hits at the right moment and can be taken seriously. Of course, you should actually mean it, and don't just apologize to manipulate. I mean to time a sincere apology correctly without rushing it because that will make things worse.

The reason this is 'unethical' is because you are manipulating the dynamics, watching your partner suffer though issues that you are sorry for or you intend to mediate, but you wait until they are a little more 'mentally broken' so they take you seriously and so that you maintain a point of control in the conversation. Don't taunt or provoke, just withhold the apology until it is getting ugly. It can be very dramatic and effective, but you have to have control over yourself and not make things worse in the argument or it will backfire. No name calling, no bringing up new issues, just passively waiting until the right moment to apologize. Try it and see.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1565538111,NSH999,1,1,True,2019-08-11

"ULPT Request - How can I convince my ISP to unlock my account, without requiring me to verify identity at Canada Post?","My mom in Toronto had technical difficulties and called the ISP, FibreStream. We both forgot that my account, under my name, provides her Internet, and she got all  personal  and security questions wrong. FibreStream  locked my account and withheld mom's Internet access until I  verify my identity, in person, at Canada Post. They insisted  in-person verification and refused to verify by Skype.

First, let me underline my full support for stricter security. Almost everyone in my extended family got an email or letter that [recent data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) affected them, like Air Canada, Hilton, Marriott, Simplii. I agree  FibreStream is being reasonable.

4. When most have got off the ride, go to the shoes and bag storage section and pretend to look for your items (new queue gets on the ride), tie your laces or something
5. Join the ride among the confusion of new people using the bag/shoes area onto the queue that you spotted at step #2

ULPT: Receive an $80 2TB LaCie Porsche Design External Hard Drive for $14.99.,"**So I found this one out by accident after I needed to try to recover data on an external hard drive.  Here's how it worked:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1.** Buy an external hard drive on Amazon. I purchased a 4TB LaCie HD ($169).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2.** Buy the rescue 3 year data recovery plan ($14.99).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 3.** Register your external hard drive on the LaCie website.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 4.** (accidentally) Reformat your Hard Drive (like an idiot, in my case) and lose all data on it. I assume you can just load the HD with a bunch of photos and music, and just delete everything as well (so long as you back it all up).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 5.** Call the rescue data recovery ppl and make a claim.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 6.** Send in your hard drive for rescue.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, they will probably be able to recover some of your data. They will call you and as if you would prefer to have download links sent to you or if you would rather the data be mailed to you. Ask them to mail it to you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 7.** A replacement for the hard drive you originally purchased will be sent to you. And about 1 week later a second hard drive containing the recovered data will be sent to you (I received a 2 TB Porsche Design Mobile Drive (USB-C) worth $80 on Amazon.

ULPT: Trick your wife into ordering you an extra meal when you order food for delivery.,"Each Sunday my wife and I order takeout from our favorite Thai restaurant. They offer free delivery on orders over $25. This typically amounts to 2 meals plus an appetizer. This leaves nothing remaining for leftovers on Monday. With her being frugal, she insists on not ordering any more than what is required to meet the $25 minimum for free delivery.

Lucky for me, her irrationality outweighs her frugality.

Over the course of weeks, I phoned and emailed the restaurant to praise their food and service.  I left many 5 star reviews on their website, Google listing, and Facebook page under various false names. Every time, I finished my praise by lightly suggesting they are too generous with their $25 minimum to receive free delivery.  I noted in several comments that they could easily raise the minimum and I'd happily order more.

It only took about a month before they raised this to $35. Now my wife feels it's better value to spend $10 more on another meal as opposed to the $5 for delivery.

ULPT request: Fighting company spams with spams,"I have a very common Gmail username to which I use as a main email. Few times a week, I get random morons that use my email address to sign up for things. I'm usually fine with this as it's been like this for years, so I either just sign in and close the account or click on the more legit links to unsubscribe to their newsletters etc.

Recently I've been getting these emails from Rangingbull Casino. I'd usually ignore the random spammers but these guys are ""legit"" and persistent, and have actual sites with membership logins etc. In saying that, they do not provide any options to unsubscribe in the emails (their spams are daily) nor anywhere in the websute to close the account or change email addresses. I could login to change password only. If I have to get on support, I'd have to be a paying member to get any (asshole design much?).

However, they DO have an email support address and have responded after a few emails that ""my"" account has been closed but the spams still come daily and have pretty much stopped responding.

I’m not sure what the EU version of “trailer trash” is, but that’s what she was.

Anyways one of her neighbors up the road got a fancy new smart TV, and like most of us, just set the box at the end of the drive for collection later that day.

Where most people saw trash, Sarah saw opportunity.

She had stopped on her way to work that morning and grabbed her neighbors tv box off the curb, she happened to have a not smart tv in the same size.

After work that evening she loaded her tv into the box, taped it closed, and headed to the store. (Huge retailer that starts with a “W”) and attempts to exchange her tv for a new smart tv. Claiming the remote wasn’t in the box when she got the tv, and she didn’t have the receipt because it was a gift.

Long story short, the exchange went off without a hitch. They never once doubted her story, much less opened the box. Sarah got a new tv and all it took was a little immortality.

ULPT: How to drive back home to your own bed on drugs so you don't crash on your friend's shitty couch," 

I hate sleeping in unfamiliar places. I hate feeling like I'm a burden when I get fucked up. I also just like driving in general, and I don't like other people driving my car. So I just drive myself (or one of my girlfriends). Here's how you can start:

1. When changing lanes, do the full-on head turn from rear view to side view to blind spot.
2. Speed limit on my freeway is 65MPH, I never go below 72mph. Cops find slow cars suspicious. Or, crazy as it sounds, *drive at the same speed as other cars also on the freeway*
3. Your stops should always start three seconds earlier than you normally would
4. Just like if you're sober, look at the lane dividers and stay between them.
5. Two second stop at stop signs and before crossing intersections (lot of pedestrians in my area)
6. Don't have a lead foot on the gas pedal

Now this just sounds like what you're supposed to do sober while driving, with extra steps, and congrats you're right! Now let's get into the specifics of each drug.

Alcohol: Everything is deadened. That means you should have your eyes glued to your front and checking your speedometer every once in a while since you can't trust your ears and feet to hear and feel how fast you're actually going. Punk music has helped me tremendously because of it's riling nature, so I'll just throw on Black Flag or Dead Kennedys in order to keep energy up and fight the lead limbs.

Weed: To be honest, never found it difficult to drive on this at all, come light or heavy traffic. You feel relaxed, you can feel the car through the pedal better, and when people do stupid things on the freeway like cut you off, you're a lot more forgiving (or at least won't let their bullshit ruin your day). The most distracted you have to worry about is talking too much to your passengers since you'll wanna make eye contact and all that fun stuff. But even just the basic six steps above gets you pretty far. You could argue Sativa being ""safer"" than an Indica strain because of the head high, but I never saw a difference in my driving style. Pretty much all music is good for me driving on this, so it's up to you to determine how aggressive or careless any particular artist or band makes you feel. The more you drive on this, the more fun driving becomes. Keep your grinder, weed jar, pipe, and lighter in your center console if you're paranoid about that stuff

Cocaine: Makes you impatient as fuck and you feel justified in being so. Driving on this the first time I had five lines, three mixed drinks, two beers, and two bowls of weed. The coke definitely helped me keep cycling all the little details in my head so I never missed a beat the entire way home, even in the middle of that hard crash. The second time it was basically just mad impatience and glimpses of road rage. As long as you remember your time is much more valuable than everyone else's, you can keep your eyes on the road and shut out all the other drivers. ScHoolboy Q, Cudi, Kanye, Kendrick, Lizzo, Poppy, disco music in general are all good choices because the idea behind coke is stimulate your conviction and keep you locked into your objective (in this case, not crashing, dying, and causing other humans inconvenience).

MDMA/MDA: Candy makes everything nicer. One of my rolls I spent the entirety driving up and down coast 1 highway because me and my primary couldn't find parking, and not once were either of us worried I would crash. After applying your six steps also just remember that again, if you have passengers, eyes on the road all the fucking time, it doesn't matter how interesting their life story is at the moment. When you start *getting the rolls* while driving, just take your foot off the gas pedal. If they're too intense, pull over. Recklessness with safety measures. Luckily since lights take up more visual info now, you'll be hard pressed not to keep in time with traffic unless you're just staring downwards. Obviously EDM and 80s synthwave should be blasting, there's no other way to [r/outrun](https://www.reddit.com/r/outrun/) in a car, but specifics I like Lab's Cloud and Ultraboss. Take time to breathe, and even just speak words to keep yourself concentrating.

LSD/Shrooms: Here's the thing with psychs: if you can even manage to turn the key while getting into the car, you've already surpassed 90% of the people who have sat in a car on psychs. That shit is terrifying. First time driving was soul crushing in the way my dad used to describe standing in the presence of God. You are faced with your own mortality and significance of the task ahead. The red brake lights can really start to make you feel suicidal, the side view mirror has this weird duality of being too close while objects are too far away to judge, and of course, the visuals can fuck. you. up. I've had everything from cars appearing softer and shinier to a phantom road that would have led me off a cliff. Driving on the straights in towns the road and perspective can elongate heavy, making it that much harder for perception. Depending on the drive, I'll either choose something like lofi hiphop or vaporwave to create a relaxing atmosphere, or I'll throw on King Gizzard or Ozric Tentacles if I need to drown out the thought loops in my head so I can focus.

Sleep Deprived: Good fucking luck with that shit. I've tried snacking, I've tried yelling lyrics, I've put every music genre under the sun on the radio, I've tried coffee, I've even paused for a nap on the side of the freeway. Imagine the rolls but without any of the alertness or awareness of anything else other than the fact you just want to stop moving. That's what staying awake feels like sleep deprived. Stay off the road, because even if you're sober you're a worse danger than someone with some sort of stimulant in them.

At some point you realize that driving while on drugs is no different than driving sober, because at the end of the day all it takes to drive and not crash is to pay attention to your surroundings. Drugs can make that harder, but again, with enough practice and decent common sense...

ULPT Request - Get back to annoying garage neighbour,"Hi all, excuse any errors, as English is my second language.

I am currently encountering the following problem:

I have rented a garage space in a large garage. My car is a bit too long for the spot I was assigned, as there‘s a beam in the back (blocking like 30cm/1ft of the length at the back). Note, that that beam doesn‘t stretch across the entire parking space, just the left 60cm/2ft of the space, leaving the rest of the space in the back rather useless..

This‘ll be important later.



Now, I‘ve never had a problem, but now the neighbour to my left actually left a note 2 weeks ago that I‘m parking way too much on his side and that he has to climb through the passenger‘s seat to get out the car. He also left his phone number.
Now, because he appears to be an older person, he‘s not using his car all too often, while I drive to work every day, I may have moved over to his side a little more in the past few weeks.

I have corrected that since (don‘t actually want to be the dick), but the older gentleman called again, yelling „nothing has changed“! He‘s trying to educate me that I would be able to scooch over to the side and park to the side of the beam (which is physically impossible). This would solve all our (his) problems, as he insists. Obviously, I tell him that it’s impossible, as there‘s simply not enough space for my car to fit there (the beam, remember). He‘s not having it, so I hang up.

He has also complained to the landlord, though I’ve not yet heard from them (maybe they’re aware of him being annoying?)

Not to mention that I also have a neighbour on the other side as well and I do need to get in and out of my car as well. The other neighbour actually has their car turned around, so that our driver‘s side doors are facing each other, as this leaves the most space to the other sides.



I told him that he could do the same with his other neighbour, it would merely require him to park his car the other way around. He will not do that, as he‘s parked the same way for 10 years, apparently. That this argument is void, as his car is definitely not that old and the SUV‘s weren‘t that big 10 years ago, is obviously not his problem.



So, that‘s my story. Does anyone have an idea how I could get back at them without doing anything illegal (guy has a police sticker on the car, so I need to make sure it‘s not traced back to me)?",UnethicalLifeProTips,1564937766,kichilron,2,2,True,2019-08-04

Once a new person starts that you've taken a dislike to start stealing inconspicuously, only do it when youre both on shift and only take stuff they have access to.

Blame will quickly fall to them as they are the newest and least trusted.

Don't do it too often and after doing it a little while ask a co-worker if they've seen them doing anything suspicious in the area you've taken stuff from, the rumour mill should start itself leading to further investigation. Failing this, you could mention to a manager unofficially they appeared to be taking something. 

In a lot of places employees have a probationary period, so they can be fired on the spot without unfair dismissal claims.

I'm not a coupon person but hey, free ice cream. So I went to Walmart and grabbed a box and went to the self-serve checkout. Scanned ice cream sandwiches, scanned coupon, beep! OK, that'll be $0.00.

What's stopping me from taking my other coupon and getting a free box of ice cream sandwiches twenty times a day from now until the coupon expires at the end of the year? I assume that when they collect the coupons and submit them to the company for reimbursement, some manager type will eventually realize ""we have 3 coupons in hand, and people have claimed 524 boxes of free ice cream sandwiches"".

Here is the icing on the cake. Most matress companies will tell you to dispose of the matress and won't even bother picking it up. They'll just refund you and apologize for the bad experience you had.

ULPT How to fool senior leaders at a fortune 100 company into thinking you're a great leader by committing felonies on foreign soil.," Let's say you work for Allstate and your name is Nark Tlusar. Now, the  only way to get ahead in your company is to achieve your own agenda by  convincing your direct reports that what you're doing is important to  move the company ahead. You have a friend, let's call him Phistopher  Nrokop. He reports to a different leader within the company. A leader  that you often have friction with. You lure another employee with money  to become your direct report into your department. You don't want to  leave it to chance that this employee is unhappy, so you plot and scheme  to have Phistopher Nrokop in the adjacent cube to the new hire.  Phistopher then shoulder surfs their password and you use contacts at  the Ireland office to hack into the new direct's personal email and  download all their conversations, emails and contacts. Now Nark reasons  that since the crime took place at an Amazon data center on foreign  soil, American Federal wiretapping laws do not apply. Nark reasons that  any threat to employee happiness allows him to break Federal laws and  commit any number of felonies as long as he doesn't get caught. However,  the new hire detects the breach in security. Google has alerted him  that a login was successful in Ireland. The new hire has never been to  Ireland and has never used a VPN. The breach is real. Nark, taking all  the information gained illegally, then plots to demoralize the employee  so they become more mentally pliable. He has done this to countless  others. He has used this information to harass them and ruin their  lives. Why not? He reasons. I'm better than them. I own them. Nark has  no morals and it is plain to see that he doesn't care about violating  people's civil rights. They'll never catch me he reasons. Nark begins to  spread a malicious rumor about the new hire. He is transgendered, he  says. People believe him. He's been fooling them for years now. He's  been committing felonies for years. He feels invincible. The lie is  perfect, he reasons. He can use it to force the new hire into marrying  someone. Surely they will cave and submit. They will have no outs except  marriage. But he was wrong. The new hire leaves the organization very  unhappy and they fire Natt Xinters the president over it. But how to  convince leaders at Allstate that his actions weren't malicious? Oh I  know, I'll pretend to help him! Little things. Things that don't cost  much. See! He reasons. I'm helping him. He has a great sense being  magnanimous.

ULPT: Cancel your gym membership,"It’s no mystery that gyms will do everything they can to hold onto your monthly draft. As a manager at a gym, I’ve found two ways to cancel gym memberships without showing proof:

1. Change your card on file to a visa gift card. Most of us have one with 25 cents left on it that we refuse to throw away. As long as you have a 16 digit gift card with an expiration, it’ll work. 

2. Medical. Wear any sort of basic brace and feign pain. You were injured three days ago, and you need the corporate entity’s fax number to send your medical receipt/note to. The corporate representative told you to go into the gym and cancel with the general manager and she will add the note to your account. 

3. Is a toss up and not a guarantee but it works with me. You’re moving to another state and driving there in one month. The only proof you have (if they ask) is that you are now employed in a different state and your manager can email the gyms manager with confirmation. Then you just have a coworker with a work email send the manager an email with confirmation of move.

I kinda freaked out when I found this out because I didn't take the class seriously at all. They make you share your screen and they also monitor the processes on your computer so virtual machines and extra monitors were not an option. However, after some research, I was successfully able to cheat on the test. Here's how:

1. Create a cheat sheet with as much info as you can cram into half a sheet of paper (either length or width-wise)
2. Print out the sheet and fold it in half
3. Place the sheet on your screen and so that it is on whatever side of your screen that the questions won't be on (for me it wad the left side but the right or bottom works too)
4. When you connect to the proctoring software, the proctor will ask you to show them your area and table. Hold the paper against the screen when you pick up your laptop to show it around
5. Keep your eyes on the screen and paper and ace that test!

Five ways to make life more wonderful are:," 

Five ways to make life more wonderful are:

Focus on communication rather than idealism

Know that you are under a lot of pressure to make you look ideal; you try to live in perfect health to be an ideal father, ideal employee or ideal partner.

I used to wake up at 5:30 am doing exercise or meditation exercises to feel you are in a higher order and then go to work early.

 

All of these things require time and effort, but it does not make you happier, but life becomes less enjoyable and joyful because it takes you the time you can spend with your loved ones. Life becomes more wonderful when you focus on communication than idealism. People and relationships bring us happiness and enrich our lives.

Stop listening to that hidden voice that tells you that you have to do more, practice more and work harder with you doing it already but always asking you for more. You need to spend time with your favorite people before time runs out. Human relationships are the most important thing in life.

2. Keep and share your own values

Do you feel that something is wrong but you do not know exactly what this thing is? You may have a job interview and everything looks fine but you feel it will not work or meet a new person who looks nice but you do not feel comfortable with him, there is something, something that can not be described.

Most of these times the feeling of having something that does not conform to your own values.

But that does not mean there is a conflict between your own values ​​and those of others

But that feeling is a sign of something that needs to be changed.

I will tell you a story that happened to me when I accepted a job with a large material return in an organization and I accepted it because the organization aims to help people, and that is what I want to do too.

Over time I found that the way the organization helps people does not correspond to my own values; publishing and implementation policies do not satisfy me. I want to write to people directly to motivate and inspire them, and I can communicate with people, but the organization appreciates building and structuring governance. Ever since I noticed that difference in values, I have become happier and things have become easier.

3. Make fear an incentive

Several years ago, I read an article written by a retired senior executive from a major institution in which he said that he worked hard for forty years, during which he spent many hours and hours with many family and friends, but finally found it was not worth it. It is unfortunate that man loses his life in vain and the time for change is over. I have always kept that story in my mind, especially when I tend to take the easier choices. I introduce myself to some of the motivational

Do I waste my life uselessly or is this really what I want?

Is what I want is difficult or scary and what will happen if I'm not brave with myself

Let fear not to try Fear of remorse and loss of your life meaningless Let fear become your motivation.

4. Do not believe in signs

Have you ever asked yourself is something happening is a signal from the universe? Here is the bare truth about the subject of signs or cosmic signs. There simply is not this thing; Falcon does not send you anything at all. When a person believes that there is a sign that supports or encourages a specific path, it means that an event or position supports that choice. Let me explain more to you, did you ask yourself one day and you are going to the market to buy chicken for lunch and find it has run out? Is this a sign of the universe to stop eating! But you just choose another category and that's what happens in general you change plans to reach the desired goals.

If Edison Bala to the markings, we now swim in darkness, the teachers saw that he is a stupid child and does not understand anything, he was separated from the primary stage because of his inability to achieve and absorption and failed to make the light bulb a thousand times .. Yes a thousand times! He explained that he did not fail but learned a thousand steps to make the lamp. Keep moving to your dreams even if it takes a thousand steps.

5. Do not stop dreaming

Do you know what Walt Disney and his team did? They used to unleash their imagination and dream to come up with the best possible ideas. The dream was the first step. In the world of dreams everything is possible and there is no room to evaluate ideas and classify them into wonderful and silly ideas. The next step was the landing on the ground where Walt and his team were thinking how to put it on track.

Then came the stage of criticism and face problems and knowledge of errors, and the development of the cost of the project. They encourage people to dream but not just dream without planning to realize those dreams

Let me make you more frankly that may be shocking to you. There are no barriers that hinder you from hinder yourself. Think of a good idea and then begin to put obstacles to implement and jump to your head justifications such as the difficulty of implementation cost a lot of money and others. With time turning to the stage of criticism before the dream afraid to dream of things you can not achieve my advice to you do not listen to the voice of criticism inside your mind, which tells you that you are not good enough.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1564456552,mouradfar1987,1,1,True,2019-07-29

"ULPT: Buy a Nintendo Switch from WalMart/Target. Return the box with a heavy book inside, closed on the sides with clear stickers from Staples. The serial number sticker is ON THE BOX. Get refund, sell Switch, profit.","The Nintendo Switch boxes, for whatever reason, are not sealed with any kind of tape. Honestly I still don't understand this but whatever. Go to Staples and buy some small circular CLEAR labels for five bucks.  


Buy the Switch. Take the switch out of the box and replace it with a book from the dollar store that is comparable in weight and size. Close the box and put one circular clear sticker on either side of the box where it closes. This makes it look like the package has never been opened before. 99% of employees have no idea that these stickers were not part of the original packaging.  


The Nintendo Switch serial number is pasted on a sticker that is on the OUTSIDE of the box. When you take it to customer service to return it, they will compare the serial number on the box with the one on your printed receipt. Because the round clear stickers are in place, they will assume you are returning unopened/new merchandise and will not look inside the box to make sure the contents are there. Your reason for return: ""My boyfriend/girlfriend and I both surprised each other for our anniversary with the same gift, but we only need one!""  


ALWAYS HAVE THE ACTUAL CONSOLE ETC... IN YOUR BAG WHILE MAKING THE RETURN. This safeguards you against the possibility that they do actually check the inside of the box. Yeah, you end up looking stupid and they probably know what you were trying to get away with, but you just say ""Oh ha ha, yeah I did that to play a prank on (boyfriend/girlfriend) when they first opened the box; I forgot to switch it back out, here's the console!"" You still get your money back, and yeah your scam didn't work, but there was no law broken and you can't get in trouble because you didn't actually rip anybody off.  


Because you have a receipt you will not be asked to show ID. The worst case scenario is that it doesn't work and you wasted some time. The best case scenario is you have your money and a $300 game console to keep or resell.

When that new babysitter turns up, pretend it’s your house and say you’ll be back at midnight. Leave with the goods, and drive back to your home.

ULPT Request: Best methods to create free trials accounts,"There are some troubles involving the creation of free trials accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

The mail is the less relevant one, there will always be a temporary mail service that isn't blocked by the site you want to create account on.

The   credit card. Most of the sites that offer the free trial, like Netflix or NordVPN, ask for credit card info to charge money once the trial period is ended. Of course, you need to put a *real* and *valid* card to be accepted by the site. Also, your card must be *charged*   with the necessary money needed after trial period. The site could  also  ask for PayPal account or cryptocurrencies instead of credit card,  but I  think there's something that goes to check if you have money in your paypal account for example.

"ULPT Request: Old friend owes me $100 but we aren't friends anymore, how do I get it back?","My best friend and I were super close and last year in August we did drugs together and she didn't pay me back at the time but said she would later. I was lenient given some situations in her life where she was unemployed and had family issues. But we recently had a big falling out because of the way she was, not giving the money back was part of it. We've been ignoring each other since. It was around $100, if I remember correctly but I can work it out properly later on. She had said a few months ago she'd start paying me back but she never did. I'm actually a lot happier without the friendship and her in my life but I really want the money back because it's a lot. 

I've come up with a couple ideas on how to get her to give me the money back but I'm looking for better ideas or suggestions to improve mine or whether they'll work or not.

The first is: Apologise and pretend I miss her and make her want to be friends again. Slowly ask our mutual friends if she's talked about me, what she's said .etc and act very sad about it so they'll tell her I was asking about her and seemed upset about the situation. Also acting a lot softer around her and more defeated. Hopefully, this would get her back on speaking terms with me and I'd be able to start to be friends again. I'd go back to how I was and seem very genuine about it and pretend to open up to her and pretend to trust her .etc. After a few weeks of this, I'd ensure I would be in a solid position with her and make sure we're like best friends again. Then I'd bring it up when the time seemed right and once she's done paying it back, I'd ghost. This obviously takes a lot of time and patience and I can't stand her but I'm willing to do it if it will work. 

Second option: Blackmail her into giving it back. I'll be sweet about it but if she refuses, I'll threaten to expose the drug use like post on her facebook or something. It's a little too extreme and I don't think I could go through with it.

Third option: I owe my other old close friend drug money. Not nearly as much but $20. She's best friends with my old best friend now and I felt out with her at the same time. I'm thinking I could try bargain with her like ""I'll pay it back if (old best friend) does"" or say something like ""I'll pay it back to you because I'm not immoral like (old best friend) who'll never pay me back because she is/isn't (borderline insult)"" which might manipulate her into giving me the money back to prove me wrong or she'll just be like ""fuck you lol"" and never give it back.

I can't decide which route to take because there's things that might go wrong and fuck it up entirely. Like if I pretend I miss her she might be like ""I'm better without you fuck off"" and then she sees me as weak and it further inflates her ego.

ULPT Request: How to sneak in backstage in a big musical festival as a volunteer?,"Alright so here's the context.

In a few weeks, there is going to be a HUGE festival where I live. The festival will be running for a week, and superstars will be singing on stage on different time appointments. 

I applied to participate in this festival as a volunteer and what do you know? I was accepted. So I will be attending the festival paying around $100 as a deposit (whereas the 7-days ticket costs $350), and I will be able to be there before, during, and after the festival.  An amazing deal IMO. I will have a 6-hours shift everyday for the entire week of the festival (the job is ridiculously easy), and after my shift is finished, I can wander around the festival as I please. 

I have already made friends with the volunteers leader and she did me a small favour by ending my shift really early on the first day so that I can attend my most favourite singer.

Here's the thing: I don't want to be amongst the audience. Pretty fucking ambitious, I know, but being a volunteer, wearing a T-shirt that indicates so, and a wristband as well, I already have an advantage over the rest of the audience as a ""part of the staff"". I want to use that advantage to sneak in the backstage. But I have no idea how. 

If shit went south, I'll be kicked out of the festival and will have my money taken, which is absolutely no problem for me. So I'm all ears, guys.

I asked the volunteers' leader if we can do it, and she basically said, ""Volunteers can't go backstage"". We're not just not allowed, but I want to sneak in, guys. If you can help me with how to do it, please do so!!",UnethicalLifeProTips,1564320375,bravoamiga1,4,4,True,2019-07-28

How to fool senior leaders at a fortune 100 company into thinking you're a great leader by committing felonies on foreign soil.,"Let's say you work for Allstate and your name is Nark Tlusar. Now, the only way to get ahead in your company is to achieve your own agenda by convincing your direct reports that what you're doing is important to move the company ahead. You have a friend, let's call him Phistopher Nrokop. He reports to a different leader within the company. A leader that you often have friction with. You lure another employee with money to become your direct report into your department. You don't want to leave it to chance that this employee is unhappy, so you plot and scheme to have Phistopher Nrokop in the adjacent cube to the new hire. Phistopher then shoulder surfs their password and you use contacts at the Ireland office to hack into the new direct's personal email and download all their conversations, emails and contacts. Now Nark reasons that since the crime took place at an Amazon data center on foreign soil, American Federal wiretapping laws do not apply. Nark reasons that any threat to employee happiness allows him to break Federal laws and commit any number of felonies as long as he doesn't get caught. However, the new hire detects the breach in security. Google has alerted him that a login was successful in Ireland. The new hire has never been to Ireland and has never used a VPN. The breach is real. Nark, taking all the information gained illegally, then plots to demoralize the employee so they become more mentally pliable. He has done this to countless others. He has used this information to harass them and ruin their lives. Why not? He reasons. I'm better than them. I own them. Nark has no morals and it is plain to see that he doesn't care about violating people's civil rights. They'll never catch me he reasons. Nark begins to spread a malicious rumor about the new hire. He is transgendered, he says. People believe him. He's been fooling them for years now. He's been committing felonies for years. He feels invincible. The lie is perfect, he reasons. He can use it to force the new hire into marrying someone. Surely they will cave and submit. They will have no outs except marriage. But he was wrong. The new hire leaves the organization very unhappy and they fire Natt Xinters the president over it. But how to convince leaders at Allstate that his actions weren't malicious? Oh I know, I'll pretend to help him! Little things. Things that don't cost much. See! He reasons. I'm helping him. He has a great sense being magnanimous.

ULPT : getting my salaries from my old Norwegian boss,"I need really pro tip.

I was working in a Norwegian company's Turkey branch. But i was dealing all EU work. Legally i was registered on Turkey Company. There is XYZ Norway in Oslo, XYZ Sweden in Stockholm and XYZ Turkey in İstanbul. The reason why i registered in Turkey was company got a governmet fund and there must be a engineer in Turkish Company. All companies founder is same person lets call it Mr.G. But there is no organic connection link between companies. Only the names (XYZ) and the founder of the companies.

I have worked 18 months in XYZ company. When i start they had nothing when in 12th month company have a factory to manufacture goods in Turkey. I was the one who done everything from all engineering work to finding the investors.

In 12th month Mr.G told me 'well mavigozludev thanks to you our factory is ready but we have no financials right now. we will have the financials 6 months later. If you can keep working 6 months without asking salary we can get the new investment with your efforts. Then i can pay your salaries+bonus also we can run the factory. Otherwise all the efforts will be wasted.'

Then i made a silly decision and accept to work 6 months without asking salaries. I was going to Oslo all the time company was just paying the expenses.

After six months company get a new investment from Sweden. Mr.G does not accept to pay my salaries and run to Sweden. The date was January 2017.

Then i resign from company for not paying my salaries and keep asking the Mr.G when he will pay the salaries. He will always replying as '3 months later we will get new investment and then i will pay your salaries' for each time company get new investment by the name of XYZ Norway and for each time Mr.G spent it for its own purposes.

It become its own work. Show the Turkish manufacturing line. Convince the Scandinavian investor if he put 300keuro-400keuro everything will be fine. Take the money. spent it. go for another investor.

I sued the company in Turkey and won. But there is no assets in bank account and manufacturing line is considered as scrap metal so it maybe covers my %10 salaries. My lawyer get not do anything else.

Suing them in Norway cost a lot and nobody give me a price range even if i can win the case or not.

I talk with the Turkish embassy in Oslo they said they dont any responsibilities like following depts for people or companies.

So i am stuck. This guy keep getting more investments as i can follow them on facebook. I told him if he not give me my salaries i told the situation the other shareholders and he threatened me with sharing inside company info to 3rd parties which could be a crime and may go to court. My lawyer said it could be true.

Sorry for long post but i want to be clear.

In my experience, I need just 2 other employees if they have (Assistant) Manager experience. 1 year ago, they quit...they hate HK's anti-democratic politics and decided to leave HK. Now only I'm left. I'm desperate for candidates — I'm overworked! Of note, 1 HKD = 0.13 USD.

I spent  $30,000 USD on [job posting sites](https://www.betterteam.com/job-posting-sites-hong-kong) and recruitment agencies, but nobody with experience as Manager applied.

Assume I can't see who's Manager, or if they're on duty. Obviously I can't say I'm headhunting!

2. If Manager is not in store, what reason to give when I request their business card? 

3. Now assume Manager is in store and goes up to me. What do I say? Requesting the Manager will make some people gape at me, and make me nervous! Manager was expecting customer — thus it feels too sudden, cheeky, and foxy to say

"ULPT: Save a ton on medical expenses by telling the billing dept you can't afford to pay that amount, even if you can.","My post got taken down in LPT because it's about medical/finance.  Thought you guys might enjoy this ULPT:

You should know that medical bills (out of pocket after insurance pays) can be negotiated down, substantially, no matter the amount, if you offer to pay in a lump sum and ""can't afford more than $X (even if you can).

Many people can't afford to pay their bills so a lot go unpaid, and after 7 years they fall of your credit report entirely (and really don't affect it all that much tbh).  And getting a fraction is far better than getting zero.  Best case, a lot of times, hospitals and the like are getting a few dozen dollars a month and patients can take years or decades to pay off that balance.  And inflation comes into play as well.

The billing dept (in my experience) will usually offer a 20-25% discount up front, just from calling in and complaining and or disputing charges/hours billed if you can write a check for a lump sum, instead of slowly paying it off.  Literally just from calling in.  I also haven't had much issue going up as high as 50% off or more.

Make sure to be respectful and apologetic....or at least agreeable, yet concerned.  Conveying stress is fine, but do NOT be irate.

""Money is tight...I want to do the right thing and pay this but I didn't expect it to be so high.  I thought insurance would cover most of this.  If I borrow (key word) some money I can probably get you [50%] in a few days.  Would that be enough to cover all this?  I don't want this hanging over my head for a year or so (key phrase).""

Only once have I been told ""No, but we can come down [25%] if you can pay [this amount] by [date].""

""Oh no, I'm sorry, but that just isn't possible.  I don't think I can get that much together that soon.  I had to miss a lot of work recently.  I'm really sorry, I guess I will have to call you guys back in a few months if things are looking better down the line.  My car has been acting up too, so I guess maybe it's best if I just hold off paying all that.... for now, anyway.  I'm really sorry for wasting your time.""

Immediately got the ""Look, I tell you what....we don't normally do this, but if you can bring us a check for [50%] by the end of the week, we will close this out.""

Tbh I stumbled across this by accident, years ago when I was overbilled on labor.  Physical therapy billed in 1 hour increments, when my appointments were 30-45 minutes max.  I bought this up and they immediately offered to take half of my out of pocket (knowing they already scammed my insurance company) if I could pay that amount in check or cash.  Decided to try something similar every time.

After that, I have significantly negotiated down several bills ranging from $50-1000+.  Every time at around half or less.  ""What is the least amount you would take, today, to consider this squared?""  Is a good one.

Fortunately I have had no major issues, so not sure how well this works for an organ transplant and the like.  But I can only imagine the massive bills are much harder to collect on.

However, I did pass this info along to a close friend who had a baby a couple years ago and even with decent insurance and only $2000 out of pocket billed, he got it down to $1000 after 5 minutes on the phone, essentially using my script.

Even if you can totally afford to pay whatever the bill is, complain and say you can't....pretty good odds they'll knock off a big chunk just to get the cash in hand.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1563732579,jakk86,5,4,True,2019-07-21

I called the leasing office for my apartment complex 4 days ago and told them about the problem. They never showed up. Today I came home to an apartment similar in humidity to a car with the windows closed, and I had left my bedroom AC (the one that works) on all day for my 2 cats.   


I immediately called the emergency maintenance line and left a message explaining the situation. I recieved a call from someone who sounded like they definitely didn't want to drive back to work. After searching for a reason not to come, he asked if I had more than 1 AC in the apartment. I told him about the one in the bedroom, but how it also doesn't spread past a 4 foot radius of the AC unit. He responded telling me it's not an emergency and that they'd come out tomorrow morning.

How:

1. Get a desktop recording tool like OBS [here](https://obsproject.com/download).
2. Get the software VirtualBox from [here](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.10/VirtualBox-6.0.10-132072-Win.exe).
3. Get a Linux OS like Ubuntu or its other Linux flavours. You can freely download any of them. Get Ubuntu [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
4. Configure VirtualBox using this tutorial [here](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/).
5. Once you are in your new virtual system, go to its browser and login to whatever service you use (Hulu, Netflix, etc.)

If you're caught in word you need to adapt. Improvise. Go beyond human limitation. Transfer the essay in word to a pdf. By doing this it will be harder to get caught.

The thing is that most hotel TVs have no Netflix and we hate crowding around a tiny ass laptop, so how do we get Netflix on?

I was thinking of bringing my Switch + the dock and hooking it up to the TV, going on the web browser and then swotching on Netflix but in case I can’t do that, are there any alternatives?

"ULPT: Unethical tips to appear more likable and better to crushes/wives/bosses, etc."," 

I’m  a professional magician, and as a magician, we use a concept called  ‘Dual Reality’.  In heart, you cause some deception to give someone a  different perspective on something than what it actually is.  An example  would be for me to write a card on my hand, then force that card on one  person then show another person my palm and have them ‘psychic read my  palm’.  One volunteer believes the other is reading their mind, the  other believes that you somehow managed to predict the card to have them  read it.  It’s weird.

Here are some things that I use in relation to that concept that makes life much easier -

Preface:   Don’t cheat on a guy or a girl or do this to multiple people with the  intention for love or something less ideal than love (trying to keep  this SFW). I hope this stuff is helpful.  I actually do this stuff and  tested it, it all works.

1. Overestimate  time:  Say you’re busy, (or less ethically, not busy at all).  I know  I’ll be finish led by 1:30, but I’ll tell someone I’ll text them back at  1:50.  Once I am available, or I feel is an opportune time to use this  little life hack.  I come back with “Hey I’m back! Sorry, it took so  long, I tried my best to hurry so I can talk to you.”

Bonus  points:  If you’re interested in them, leave them with a compliment,  example -&gt; “Hey, saw your latest picture on Instagram, you’re  unbelievably gorgeous, but I gotta do some stuff, I’ll text you at  \_\_\_\_.”  Overall makes your compliment appear more genuine and less  desperate.  Takes away any potential less ideal than love motives away  from it.  Also, almost a hard to catch sort of vibe.

2.   I already did it:  Actually found this somewhere on this sub I  believe, I tested it, and wow.  So it works like this.  If your wife or  whoever is not around and calls/texts you to ask you to do something?  Say you already did it.  THEN do it at that moment or later.  It makes  you seem like you’re better put together or a better listener if they  asked you to do it before leaving.  If anybody can find the post, all  credit goes to them, not me.  However, it is a great idea.

Edit:  More ethical tip below, it is just there to aid with tips 1 and 2.

3.  Direct, not creepy:  Actually ethical, but for the sake of continuity  and having it all in one place.  I found that I always had a 'cute'  middle school way of flirting, for example, ""Hey, you know you are kinda  cute""  Usually the response was ""Oh, just kinda?""  Whether they were  playing along or actually offended, I found that I was more successful  in the social world when I cut out words that show I am not sure.  In  introspect, if you are going for a cutesy way of flirting, maybe for a  degree of comedic value, then sure, go 'head.  Though, I found that  people like it better when I say something more direct in nature like  ""Wow, you're stunning, my eyes can go without regrets.""  May help as  well to cut out your ums and likes.  Instead make pauses to think, or do  actions in-between times of stumbling on your words.  The goal for  flirting at least is not to be creepy with it, complimenting and leaving  as in number 1 is a great way to set the tone that you are not creepily  trying to do it.  At least it worked for me, also, get to know somebody  before dropping huge compliments on appearance, if you aren't in the  place to say stuff, compliment shoes or shirts, sometimes the hair is  acceptable if you bring up a conversation about your hair?  Not sure  why, but it just worked for me, hopefully, does for you.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1563408417,reefgod,11,51,True,2019-07-17

ULPT: Do you have a lien against your house? Make it go away with this neat little trick.,"Ok so here's my contribution: 

So my mom inherited the family house from my grandmother many years ago. She also refinanced the house at some point in time. She was sued by di$c0√=€® card and the final judgement was that a lien was put on the house.  

She had refinanced through a very well known bank and then most recently that same said bank sold the mortgage to another company.

We went to the courthouse today for some personal affairs and a search through the database yielded no lien judgement anywhere....see what happened?

Refinanced=got sued=lien on house=mortgage got sold to another company= no more lien on house. Probably got sold with the mortgage making the house free and clear...well other than the monthly mortgage payment of course which stands unaffected.

Super smart guy, but thinks she is in a plot to kill him, and so wanted to ignore the fact that he was on trial in order to 'expose' the criminal ring.

Courts said he can't/won't aid and assist. So they had him get diagnosed: Delusional Disorder. However he won't take meds and so can't be restored to competency. Which means... He's free to go!

"UPLT Making money from female NEETS (Not in education, employment or training) by farming smelly socks. Read below..."," 

Due to the introduction of online games, an increase in mental health problems and a reduction in employment prospects, increasing numbers of young people are becoming NEETS (not in education, employment, training etc). Including females.

I have a way to help them gain a source of income, make a little bit of money for my self, while none of us have to lift a finger to do work. The plan? Smelly socks.

Beforehand - Amass a saving of $10,000

1. I first rent a large 6-7 bedroom house in less developed area of the USA, such as Alabama, where the rent would only be 2000-3000 USD per month.
2. I post an ad on the NEET section of subreddit offering female NEETS with free rent and food, and free internet (hopefully 5G). They can stay in their rooms all day and go on online games or 4chan and I will cover their expenses.
3. However, there is one condition: They must wear socks and tight knee high leather boots indoors the whole time, changing every 2 days and only taking them off to sleep or shower. And they can only change their panties once per week.
4. At the end of each week, i collect the 3 pairs of smelly socks and 1 pair of dirty panties from each girl (7 total). I sell each pair socks and panties for $150 to older men online. Each week, each girl makes me $600 USD. All 7 girls per month would net me 600 x 7 x 4 = $16,800 per month!!!
5. Expenditures (per month)  
Rent: $3000  
Energy bills: $80 x 7 = $560  
Food: $300 x 7 = $2100  
Water: $25 x 7 = $175  
Internet: $25 x 7 = $175  
Toiletries: $100 x 7 = $700  
Clothes: $150 x 7 = $1050

ULPTR: Creating a gofundme,"I’m down on really bad times , just as I’m sure as the rest of us have our own trials and tribulations . But it just seems to me that life is working against me at all angles . 

I (24m) dropped everything took care of a very dear family member for ~ two years . The evolution from my first memories, watching their health plummet, to seeing them in a nearly vegetative state and eventually watching their soul leave their body put me in the most depressed state I’ve ever been in. I know they are in a better place, but I’m the type of person to think ‘what could I have done better’ and it’s a burden on me that I try to shake everyday. 

Anyways, It’s been about a yeAr, and I still think about it everyday. I wanna say that same weekend, or the following weekend , I was employed already working back full time. In retrospect, I know that was a mistake. But at the time, I figured getting back into a regular life (24/7/365 in home hospice care) and just socializing everyday would help me get over it. It did for awhile, but as time passed, it really hit me a few months down the road. At this point, I’m bawling my eyes out everyday. I don’t talk to anyone about it, so I eventually got into therapy. However, something happened with my insurance, and I was left with a 700+ bill for maybe two or 3 sessions. I have a child , and a few other expenses. So not only did I let that one go to collections, I just gave up on therapy all together. I began going out and trying that route of masking it with drugs and alcohol, and that’s when it took a turn for the worst. The feeling of depression ramped up and it was taking a toll on my everyday life . It got so bad that I had to request to take a day off work, which my employer met with negatively. Don’t know if it was the best decision , but I quit on the spot. I made it clear what was going on, and was scolded anyway due to a short staff. I quit on the spot because out of the 9 months I worked there, it was maybe the 2nd time I’ve called out. 

I’ve always experienced slight neck pain for reasons unknown to me, but as time passed, it got to the extreme . I was working full time, and also a very avid weight lifter. Over time, the pain got so bad that I had to stop working out, and before I quit, I was already looking for a new job where I didn’t have to look down all day. I eventually went to the dr, and I have neck spasms and diffusion. 

On top of all this, my car starts working for an unknown reason . I’ve tried YouTube videos, having friends who work on cars see what the problem is, and no luck. I can’t rely on doordash or even going back to a 9-5, so for the last few months I’ve been really assed out. I’ve been finding motivation to work again, but I’m in so much pain that I can’t even partake in my own hobbies. If I were to make a gofundme, to help get myself out of debt (don’t even have a bank account anymore, credit score plummeted due to not working) what would my chances be?

TLDR: I need some help financially . I have a desire to work, but I’m in too much pain, mentally and physically . Can’t afford physical therapy , meds or even to fix my car to get me there. Is this a viable reason to make a gofundme?",UnethicalLifeProTips,1563320431,Awisemanonceshutup,2,1,True,2019-07-16

ULPT: Make (Or Save) Thousands Selling Sneakers And Designer Clothes,"**This post is intended for people that want to become sneaker/apparel resellers, but do not know how or have the means to buy expensive items through retail.** 


I own a textiles factory and moderate r/ReputableKicks. Other than owning a factory or apparel brand, the best way to make quick profit is to resell grey market items. Everyone does it including the biggest online shoe authentication shops, the most popular Instagram influencers, and many well known sneaker consignment shops. 


Step 1: Find your product niche. (Athletic shoes, designer shoes, clothing, or bags &amp; accessories)


Step 2: Setup an Instagram or other social media account and buy followers. Perception is reality. 


Step 3: Buy items factory direct that have substantial resell value. For example most grey market shoes will cost $140 to $240 and the retail or resale value should be $400 $1,500. Designer items have great margins. 


Step 4: High definition photos and videos are a must! Presentation is the most important part of selling. Invest in a good camera and photo editing software or know someone that is handy with photography. This is the difference between your items being called replicas and someone making a purchase. Quality presentation is how all of the top social media influencers gain credibility, despite wearing and selling grey market products right in front of you.

Step 5: Market to your sales channel. There are tons of mobile apps, websites, and meetup  groups where you can sell your products. Find which one works best for you. 


If you like nice clothes but are not into reselling, then you can save tons of money by wearing grey market pieces. Clothing and apparel all come from the same factories regardless of it being a retail item from the mall, a B-Grade from an outlet, or a factory direct item.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1562809881,ReputableKicks,2,1,True,2019-07-10

ULPT: Want to cheat on any exams without getting caught?,"Hi r/ULPT. 

The following is an easy guide to cheating on exams - use at your own risk.

Ingredients: 
Apple Watch (preferably smaller model, but any will do).

“Notebook” app from AppStore.

Method
The method behind this trick is relatively simple, however it won’t be as simple as “wear the Apple Watch hurr durr”.

What you’re going to do is open the notepad app on your phone. From here you can create as many different documents as you want. These may be for different exams (if you’re planning on doing this multiple times) or different topics within the same exam. From here you make your revision notes, and type them into your phone. The notepad app will then sync over to your Apple Watch.

At this point you are ready to go into the exam, you will take the straps off your Apple Watch, so that it is nothing more than a small tile that fits into your palm. (Ensure all sound is off, on phone and watch)

The benefit to this is that even if you’re required to leave your backpack at the front with your phone on it, the Bluetooth connection will still connect (providing you aren’t extremely far).

At this point all you need to do is open notepad on your watch and scroll through your notes. Everyone else will be none the wiser.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1562662640,sufnensjsjzkjcbfb,4,0,True,2019-07-09

I’m sure the person took a photo of the ticket and put it on my car hoping I’d go online and pay it thinking it was mine. They will probably check online the last day they can pay without penalties and see if I absent-mindedly paid.

[Request]: A legal eyesore to piss off the neighbors.,"I just bought a house that has a detached one-car garage.  It's aluminum, and the roof is coming off.  At the moment, it's not a danger to my property or the neighbors' (there's plenty of space between the garage and their yard, cars, house, etc.  I've planned from the beginning to tear it down, but I've had other projects that took priority, like a new AC before summer, a new furnace before the winter, and a few other things the borough required of me.  My stepdad, who has general contracting and HVAC knowledge has been helping me with some things, but he in the last two years caught a terrible bout of pneumonia, had a heart issue that required a pacemaker, and was just recently diagnosed with emphysema.  His help is slow going, and while I do what I can, I'm working full time and putting together a grad school application.  I only have so much free time and funds to do work.

This weekend, my neighbor stopped me to complain more about the garage.  I told him I had plans to tear it down and put up a new one.  He asked why my stepdad hasn't been helping me, because he seemed to have started a few projects and never finished them.  I got snippy and told him he's been ill for the last year and a half.  He then told me that ""a garage there is quite an eyesore, do you really want to put one up?""  You know, you're right Jim.  I really wouldn't want that sort of eyesore.

&amp;#x200B;

I was initially going to have a property survey and install a privacy fence to take care of the ""eye sore"" until I can actually demolish. I was going to put a fence in eventually... considering it sooner out of spite.

What legal eyesore could I put there instead of a garage?  Something way more tacky.  I'm thinking an old school aluminum car port.  Maybe a mural on the side of my house that faces their yard?",UnethicalLifeProTips,1562592755,kimbylouwho,3,2,True,2019-07-08

We'd get the same woman come in every month or two who ordered her tickets online.  She'd wait for new staff to be hired, which depending on the season could be every month or every three. 

She'd push the boat out on Gallery Tickets (the £25/$30 seats where they sell hard liquor), load up on the small bottles of white wine, watch whatever movie it was for and just before the credits she'd come out and complain that the movie was too violent, or too much nudity/swearing/was a kids movie/the cinema was too hot/cold, people were talking too loudly.. basically any excuse that would get her a refund.

She'd then browbeat the new hire until they are forced to call a manger, the woman would then spin a tale at how the new hire was shitty with her and mocking her reasons for not liking the movie.  She'd also do it in the camera blindspots. so its her word against new hires.

The upswing of  this is she'd get her tickets refunded, the food and drink refunded, and given 12 free tickets (the standard given for employee abuse of ""guests"").

I feel shitty for repeating this when i left their employ.. but they fired me for really bullshit reasons to avoid giving me a full time contract.. so i do what i learned from here every time I visit that cinema (besides belittling the new hires).  I havent paid for a movie i have wanted to see now for the last 3 years using her methods.

Fire following an earthquake is almost certainly not excluded (although this may vary by region, or carry a smaller limit or high deductible). In fact, the exclusion in the policy wordings often explicitly states that land movement and earthquake is excluded ""except for ensuing loss or damage which results from fire or explosion."" Those carrying home or rental insurance without earthquake coverage who do happen to have a fire after an earthquake would very likely be able to make a claim.

ULPT: Flip cars belonging to the recently deceased.,"Shortly after my dad passed, we received a call from an unknown number, asking if we were selling a car. He said he’d seen a car advertised In out area, and wasn’t sure he had the right number. With dads car still on the drive, and a funeral to pay for, mum snapped his arm off. She sold the car for about half its value, and to this day is grateful this exchange happened.

Later in life, I met a guy in the pub who plays in my pool team. He is a mechanic, and told me how he makes a good living on top of his regular income.

He told me he checks in at the local crematorium on a regular basis and looks at obituaries in the local paper. He finds the deceased on Facebook, then sends a friend request to someone who has made a facebook post offering condolences. If they accept, he asks for the contact details of the widow, saying he is an old friend of the deceased, can’t make the funeral, but wants to pay his respects and donate to a charity. If someone passes on the widows number, he calls, and says he’s seen a car advertised in the area. 

More often than not, the widow will say yes. He then looks up the resale value of the car and gives them a lowball cash offer. He flips these cars via his garage, and makes another salary on top of his day job doing so. He told me his ‘clients’ can’t thank him enough and say things like ‘I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t shown up’

When he told me this my jaw dropped. I realised this is exactly what happened to my mum, and it turned my stomach. That said, as far as life pro tips are concerned, this is about as unethical and effective as it gets.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1562350081,xkombatxwombatx,1,7,True,2019-07-05

ULPT: Could you travel around with bed bugs in a container and use them to get free hotel/airbnb nights?,"So about a year and a half ago I got rid of a bed bug infestation, I read a post on facebook about how my friend had bed bugs at a hotel.  

&amp;#x200B;

Cue some curiosity and research and I found out that with proof of bed bug infestations 99% of the time(and in some cases, even without proof) you can generally get most-if not your entire stay at an airbnb or hotel for free.

&amp;#x200B;

What if you were to just travel around with a few bed bugs kept in a secure location, put them on the bed and take pictures of them, maybe even show one of the bugs to hotel staff.  Then you just put them back in a jar or something and sleep tight knowing your entire trip has a 99% chance of being partially refunded or free

&amp;#x200B;

I would see virtually no way to counter this, its not like they can put a camera in your hotel room.  Bed bugs can come from literally anywhere, if they checked for an infestation in a particular room, realistically they could have simply come from another room in the hotel.

&amp;#x200B;

When I really think about this I see almost absolutely no way this could backfire and seems like a very effective method of free travel

2. Make sure there’s at least 2-3 other cars in the drive thru with you. The busier, the better. No minimum wage employee is going to hold up the line to argue with you or try and contact the day manager to verify your claims.

"ULPT: If you have bad anxiety about seeing a dentist, have a friend make the appointment and come with as your ''caregiver'' and tell the dentist you have the mental capacity of a five year old. You will get gentler care.","Dentists are extremely careful with children, they do things much slower, and will carefully prepare the child mentally for anything that may be uncomfortable, and will even put them out for procedures adults are expected to be mature enough to withstand. They also don't scold them for poor personal dental care, and they usually get a toy, or fun child's toothbrush after. 

By having a friend make the appointment and pretend to be your caregiver, you are much more likely to get careful, patient treatment, and if you panic or feel uncomfortable the dentist will stop and be far more understanding. You will have to behave somewhat like a child, but five year olds do get quite and nervous at appointments, so saying little and following instructions would suffice, I've been around adults with limited mental capacity who speak normally, they just have a more limited vocabulary, and have difficulty being articulate. Sticking to ''yes'' ''no'' ''I don't know'' will get you there.  If you feel you can't pull this off, have your 'caregiver' tell the dentist your 'non verbal' and can only communicate with text on your phone, and only feel comfortable doing this with the caregiver, it's more plausible than it sounds, and society gives disabled folks a lot of latitude, and usually don't question these situations unless something is clearly contradictory. Don't pull a wired face or do anything with your body to ''Sell it'' at most, gently rock back and forth a little, it's simple body language that your uncomfortable but trying to stay calm, it usually makes other people sympathetic towards you, and they'll act kindly to you. 

The ''caregiver'' you pick should be a friend who's a bit arrogant, narcissistic, or full of themselves, they will gladly do all the talking, be the center of attention, and enjoy the ego boost of people seeing them as a professional aid for disabled folks, they don't have to pretend to be anyone they aren't, anyone with a HS diploma can work as a caregiver, most of thier training is to handle a specific individual's needs and they can even say it's a volunteer part time position, and they can still use thier normal identity and profession when talking about themselves, if anything this makes thier status as a caregiver even more impressive.

ULPT: want to see 2 or even 3 movies at the price of one? Spend a simple 5 min to align the times of when a movie you want to see end and when another beginds. Pay for a ticket for the first at a theater which doesnt have assigned seating then simply walk into the next when first is done (see disc),"Read the full disc to never get caught whilst doing this. They will usually check on your way in to where the movies actually are for a ticket, thus why you have to buy the first but after that just walk from one theater into the next. So many people go to the movies fpr new releases especially that even if the staff pay attention they wont notice one guy every ~2 hours, this wont work for groups in general, 2 people might be ok but keep in mind that each additional person decreases the chance exponentially from pretty good to you will get kicked out and even banned due to groups being fat more noticeable than individuals. Also bear in mind that many theaters may have 2 or more movie areas so if the next movie you had planned to hop into doesnt appear when you walk out of the previous one, just look for one that started less than 20 minutes ago or one that starts in 20 minutes or lesa and go to that one instead. If a movie is set to start in  30 or 40 minutes, just go into thr bathroom for 10-20 min in a stall nobody will pay you any heed. Chancea of getting caughy increase with each movie you go into which is why no more than 2-3 in a day is recommended. Also best not to do it in the same theater back to back, you can watch up to 9 movies relatively safely paying for just 3 by going to 3 diff theaters, or if you must use the same theater by doing it no more than once a week to avoid becoming a ""regular"" which you want to avoid for obvious reasons. This should be sufficient as most movie seasons dont contain more than 9 worthwhile movies. Extra tip bring a large but not super noticeable bag with which to store all food and drink you bring or buy, and never spend more than 20 seconds deciding which movie to go to next /to go to bathroom to wait for a new one to start and never stand still while doing so. People can take a while to figure out the theater of their movie so as long as you dont take over 20 sec and stay moving you should be golden. If you take too long or for some other reason a staff memeber comes and asks if you need help ALWAYS SAY you are looking for the bathroom, any other response could end in them aaking to see your ticket for one reason or another which is bad for obvious reasons. Keep these thinga in mind and with under 10 minutes of prep time you can watch 2-3 movies pretty safely without paying for the majority with a very low amount of work involved and at most just a bit of patience.

ULPT: You can get wealthy people to pay for you meal with simple magic and a good attitude.,"My parents took my girlfriend and I on a cruise. One night we were having dinner in the fancy steak house.  There’s a magician that does little tricks for the tables, which is usually fairly simple but also impressive especially if you’ve been drinking. 

The restaurant wasn’t very full; our side had us, one young couple and a table of four 45-60 year olds all very drunk and having a good time. Once we had all seen the magicians’ acts, we broke the ice with them and discussed the “magic” for a bit as well as some other small talk. 

One of the guys asked someone if they had cash and says I got a magic trick for you. My dad gave him a 20 so the guy says “All money has 3 things on it. A famous president, a type of cream and a famous movie. Any idea what they are? Well, The answer is Andrew Jackson.  Half and half (*rips money in half*) and Gone with the Wind (*throws bill in air*).” 

He snorted and then immediately gave my dad a clean $20 out of his wallet and said something like “sorry I couldn’t resist”. We went back to our dinner after a short good laugh and more discussion here and there.  It was pretty funny how he did it, although it can definitely be rude if someone were to do it at the wrong person, I’m sure. 

At the check, we noticed they were finishing around the same time. My dad laughed to himself and got up. Soon after he returned and then the waiter a few seconds after with our check. My dad waited to pay until the table of 4 men got their check as well, at which point my dad asks if they want to see a trick as well. He lifts up our bill and rips in half proclaiming “i can send my bill to your table simply by ripping it up.” (They hadn’t even noticed our bill had been added to theirs, I presume because they were hammered) so when the guy looked down he was amazingly shocked at how my dad could have pulled off such a trick. He starts laughing and saying how he has to pay for our dinner now. My dad walked over and shook his hand and admitted he just had the waiter in on it, but the rich table of four laughed and said they didn’t care because it was funny nonetheless. They refused to let us pay for our meal, so we quickly accepted the offer. We talked more and left all smiles in the room. 

So basically, we sent our bill to a drunk table pretending it was a dumb magic trick yet when we went to fix it (waiter had real checks as well ready to give us) they wanted to pay for our meal anyways.

ULPT Request - Help me get free laundry!,"Hey Guys,

I recently moved in to a new apartment, and there is a coin-op system for laundry. It's $2.00 for washer, and $2.00 for dryer. That's actually a lot of money for me. Can anyone help me out with a way to get free laundry? I've heard of putting straws in the coin slots, but I don't have straws. I've heard about buying the key too. But then I don't know what key would work. Please help me out if you can!

ULPT Advice: what’s an injury / sickness that’s an unquestionable get-out-free card for work and serious commitments?,"Basically, if you told someone this happened, it would be an automatically accepted and understandable excuse, like a concussion. My situation involves a very unsavory position counseling at a sleepaway camp where they would know the validity of my situation because I have personal connections.
I’ve thought about the concussion route but faking it seems a bit hard and like a slippery slope, and inflicting it could definitely go very wrong. I thought about a bad poison ivy infliction but I feel like that might not be bad enough to get me out and would be more of a suck it up and get to work situation, even though on the plus side infliction is easy and has basically no other backlash besides misery.
Other situations can get rocky because of the doctor involvement/ need of doctor proof. 
What I’m looking for and what hopefully you generous redditors can provide is unflappable excuses to avoid commitments.

ULPT: Tired of assholes jeopardizing the lives of your children by driving 60mph down your 25mph residential street? Use aquarium gravel!,"My street has a direct, one mile connection between two terribly busy roads and not even one intersection.  It is the perfect way to avoid rush hour traffic.  However, some people insist on driving at least **double** the speed limit, and there are children playing in the yards, including a deaf child, for which there is a sign to mind your speed.  We even had a pedestrian struck by a pickup truck last year.  After several of the neighbors and I requested more ""children at play"" signs and speed bumps, and absolute *zero fucks* given from the city, I decided to take the matter into my own hands...

I purchased dozens of bags of aquarium gravel that matched the exact color of my street's asphalt from the local pet store.  I sprinkled several generous handfuls every third of a mile on my street three times per week.  As the cars rocket down the road, the gravel violently kicks up and riddles the car, which **terrorizes** the paint job.  

After only four weeks, the problem was almost eliminated.  The police put notices on mine and every neighbor's house trying to determine who was spreading the gravel.  NOT EVEN ONE resident (that I know of) pulled a Henry Hill and ratted me out.

UProtip: I strongly recommend examining the gravel before you buy it and select a type with jagged edges, but even the smooth, round type will work just fine.  The most important thing is to match the color of your road as closely as possible.

**TL;DR:** Save your children and yourself against felonious speeders by spreading aquarium gravel that matches the color of your's streets asphalt.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1561175864,Earthicus,3,7,True,2019-06-21

ULPT Request: How to get out of lease?,"Hi, I signed up for The Mix (a student residence for Georgia State) a few months ago, but my brothers came home from college during spring break and advised against it. My dad got a voicemail saying we didn't reach the income requirement anyway, so I thought that was that. We lost a $100 application fee, but that was alright. I signed up for campus housing and am planning to stay there.

Fast forward to last week, I get an email with my room assignment and I'm thoroughly confused. I call The Mix and the girl says I have to pay another $100 before we can get the cancellation process going (it's actually $200 but my security deposit subtracts some). So I tell my parents, and I called again yesterday, ready to pay the $100.

The girl on the phone then tells me that even though we didn't meet the income minimum, that just means that all my preferences were lost, or something strange like that and that one of my guarantors (my dad) was approved. She then tells me there is no way to cancel, and that I need to get someone to sublease it.

My dad called today, and explained the whole situation. The lady today said that we called her back and offered a supplemental income, which was completely false. She also said that my dad signed an addendum after that message she left, so we should've knew we had been approved. I don't remember it being that way, but I haven't checked the dates on that in order to be sure. But all in all, she was saying I have no other options besides living there or subletting. I have no idea what to do now. Could there be a loophole? ANY help would be appreciated.

I told my older sister about it, and she keeps telling not to worry and that if all else fails, to just not move into that place. I'll get evicted after not paying for 30 days and that'll be that. Our credit scores will probably take a hit but they won't waste their time taking me to court or anything, so should I just NOT move into the place or not bother with subletting? This sounds pretty reckless but I don't know. Any advice?

It'll be met with opposition almost assured. Start rambling about how you stacked promo codes and played around with the website (be NICE on the phone) and end up saying politely, "" I can either book the skydiving on Groupon for $95 or I'll just book it through you which is much easier"".

ULPT: How to get unlimited pictures printed for free.,"Not sure as this fits in the sub, it *could* be illegal but I don’t think so since it’s technically a loophole. 

So, there’s this app called Groovebook. It’s a subscription service that lets you pick 100 pictures per month and they’ll print them and send them in a book. It’s actual photo paper and the photos are perforated so you can tear them out and frame them if you want. When signing up, use the code “MYFREEBOOK”. This will get you your first book for free. When that book arrives, there will be a new referral code in the back that lets a “friend” get their first one free too. Now all you have to do is make a new account and keep using the new referral codes you get. 

Now you may be asking: “Why can’t I just order more with the same coupon code?” I tried that before, and a few days after placing my second order on my new account, I got an email saying my order was canceled because the “MYFREEBOOK” coupon code had already been redeemed by someone at the same address, my original account. I’ve been doing this for a little while now and cycling the referral codes hasn’t failed yet. :)",UnethicalLifeProTips,1560923766,OofDotWav,13,15,True,2019-06-19

ULPT: How to be an alcoholic without getting caught from a former Sober House Manager,"It's really hard to be an alcoholic and not have people notice. It always ends badly. However, I have experience in how to elongate the period of time before you get caught and/or die from alcoholism or ask for help. 

- ***Breath***/***Smell***

This has always been a classic giveaway for the alcoholic. To avoid this, you'll want to stick to Vodka, because it is the most invisible so you're not masking other scents, just alcohol. 

You'll want to invest some stock money into peanut production companies, and then buy peanut butter in all it's forms you can. The PB bites are a really good dry option that carry well, but a plain old jar of peanut butter will cover vodka much more than mouthwash will. 

For smell, remember you secrete alcohol out of your pores, so showers are key, and lotions with scent help as well. 

 - ***Sneaking Booze In/Out***

Buy a commonly accepted beverage with a closable lid and claim to love it. Pour out the liquid and replace with vodka. Add coloring agents as necessary. Buy several so that if someone wants a sip of your *ahem* Gatorade you can just offer them another. This way, you never have empty bottles or cans in your way. 

- ***Staying Productive***

Okay, you are playing life on hard mode. If you don't want to stop enjoying drinking, you will need to push so much harder than others. You'll have to battle decisions between feeling awful from withdraw or drinking and performing your job. Make sure you can't go to jail from your job (ex: doctor, engineer) and make sure you never get a DUI. Find work that suits these type of alcoholic pursuits, and either work from home or in a city with transportation that can get you there without your car. 

- ***Plan an excuse for everything in advance***

Your face will get red. You got sunburnt. You sleep in too late. You were up late and decided to try an OTC sleeping pill. You're running off to the bathroom too much. You have a condition you're not comfortable disclosing. 

Never get in a situation where you're not ready to have a narrative for any erratic behavior. 

- ***Acting Classy*** 

Social Media is not part of your drinking. Hide your phone. Log on to reddit or youtube or something. When you're hammered you google Prince solos and not your ex girlfriend. Just don't, ever, be guilty by admission via insane behavior online. 

- ***Get some help cause you're gonna die***

Alcoholic tip #1. This shit is not worth it, it isn't fun, and you're gonna die. People like helping someone who admits they have a problem. The shame will melt away soon and they will be proud of you for overcoming an obstacle. 

You got this, I believe in you.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1560831717,AnalyzePhish,246,3800,True,2019-06-18

Open the phone and bleach the water damage indicators with a Q-Tip until they turn from red back to white (this will take a few minutes of dabbing, it is not instant). Make sure to clean the inside of the phone with rubbing alcohol and let dry to remove the bleach smell. Carefully rebuild the phone, make every effort to make it seem no one has opened it before, and make sure to replace adhesive tape if you removed any. This can be tricky, as if they find out you tampered with your phone you're out of luck, as this usually voids any warranty. However, when I brought my phone to the Apple repair shop, they didn't suspect a thing and said that the ""motherboard had fried"", and it was still within the 6-month warranty (free replacement) period.

ULPT How to avoid paying tv license," 

So I am not entirely sure if this post fits this subreddit, so I apologize in advance

This story is about a good friend of my dad, we'll call him M. In the country I live in you need to pay a separate license for you tv to be able to legally allowed to use it. The TV-Authority will call you and sometimes knock on your door to see if you posess a tv and if, they will have you pay for licensing. A lot of people however will avoid paying this license by simply telling the authorities that they don't own a television, because if you keep telling them this they will often stop asking and you won't have to pay. Weird thing is also that you actually don't need the license to be able to use the tv. So naturally heaps of people will lie about not owning one.

Now, my dads friend had avoided paying for his licensing for a LONG time which he was very proud of. He had also decided to buy a new and better tv as the one he currently had was running old. He went and bought a new one and there was not a problem, yet. A few days later the authorities called:

M: Hello?

Caller: Yes hello I am calling from the authorities, is it correct that you recently bought a new television?

M: Ehh... Yes I suppose that is correct

Caller: We'll as you probably know you are required to pay for licensing and that is why we have called you today

M: Oh... Of course, but you see the thing is ehh... The tv is not for me...

Caller: What do you mean sir?

M: It's ahh.. It was gift for my parents!

So in just a brief phone call M managed to f\*ck his parents over big time because, as you might expect, they were not paying for their license either. M knew know of course that this was just a short standing solution but he didn't really know what else to do.

A few days later the authorities called again:

Caller: Yes hello again Mr M. We contacted your parents and they had no clue about a television. Is it really true that you you bought this tv for them?

(It was about now M got his mastermind idea)

M: You did what!?!

Caller: Well... as I said we...

M: Did you tell my parents about the tv?! That was my suprise gift for them! Why would you ruin such a thing?!

Caller: I am sorry but we were under the impression...

M: I don't care about you explanations, you've ruined the suprise and now I might aswell return the tv, typical TV-Authority!

"ULPT: Booked non-refundable travel and need to cancel, but the merchant won't work with you? Dispute the charge and get most or all of your money back.","FYI This will typically only work with CCs issued by major banks.

Here is the skinny:  When you dispute a charge, you are the bank's (CC issuer) primary customer, not the merchant (they are secondary), and their default is to be 100% on your side.  Typically when you dispute a charge the merchant has 90 days to respond to the dispute, and 180 days to issue sufficient evidence that the charges are legit and no mistakes were made.

Quite often, the time and effort and labor that goes into disputing isn't worth trying to fight the charge versus the utility of refunding the charge and opening up the booking to another potential customer.  Secondly, if the merchant doesn't issue a response to contest the dispute within 90 days, you win by default.  If they can't provide evidence of no wrongdoing / mistakes / tried to work with you, etc within 180 days, you win by default (you also get to submit your own documents to refute theirs).

On top of that...major banks (Amex, Visa, MC, etc) get paid a percentage and sometimes a base fee on top of that....every time one of their customers swipes their card *at that merchant*.  In order to keep you happy, they will often leverage their relationship with the merchant and cover a portion or all of the disputed amount by issuing future credits towards these fees to make it a wash and keep everyone happy...which adds a third tier of protection.

Hotels and events etc are rarely an issue, but airlines are often tricky.  They're almost all non-refundable flights by default and its known that major airlines will offer full credit to be redeemed within 12 months if you cancel a reasonable amount of time ahead.

Remember that charges on a CC are *the bank's money* until you pay them off.  Which is why the service is exponentially better than what you would experience at a cash bank (Wells, BOA, etc).

Thought this might be a good tip for some of you in the event some company tries to stick it to you through fine print or some BS even if you cancel months in advance.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1560729877,jakk86,2,2,True,2019-06-16

ULPT-- Your Jacket Sleeves are the Perfect Place to Sneak in Food and Bottle Drinks into the Movies,"Movie food prices are highway robbery of the highest order

I learned that you can easily sneak in food if you just slide the food into your jacket sleeve right at your tricep/elbow area then tuck your arm to your body naturally and just hand them the ticket.  I also have my jacket open so they can see my T-shirt.  

Doing this, I can sneak in a bag from Jack-in-the-Box (burger and fries) in one sleeve and a liter soda of Mountain Dew in the other sleeve.  

I then just sit at my seat and wait for the lights to go down and the movie to start and then I break out the food.

The easiest thing to sneak like this though are Subway Footlongs with chips and of course a 1 liter or 20oz bottle of soda in the other sleeve.

"ULPT: Want to get FREE items off of eBay or AliExpress? Make sure to select a shipping option that DOESN'T include tracking information. Then after purchasing the item, wait around two months. After two months, you can then open a request/dispute and safely claim that you ""didn't receive the item"".","**Since both websites are designed completely different, here are the procedures for each one:**

* eBay: 
 1. Go to the homepage or just any page and click on *[""Help &amp; Contact""](https://ocsnext.ebay.com/ocs/home)*
 1. Under *Popular solutions*, select *""Didn't receive an item""* | OR for the US site, just click on *""Get help with an item that hasn't arrived""*
 1. (For Canadian site only) Press *""Open a Request""*
 1. Select the item you want a refund/resend on
 1. If it tells you to wait until a certain date, then come back and do this again on that date
 1. You'll finally be brought to the page where you have the option to either get a refund or get the item again (your choice). Then write some BS message, confirm that you aren't lying, and send the request.
 1. From my experience, most eBay sellers will refund you instantly. However sometimes they will want you to wait one week more. So just wait for one more week and then be like ""hey it's been one week and I still didn't receive the item"". Usually after this they will refund you. If not, then you just have a super stingy seller (which fortunately is quite rare on eBay).

* AliExpress:
 1. Go to your *""My Orders""* page and select *""Open Dispute""* on which ever item
 1. Select ""Refund Only""
 1. Select *""No""* to *""Did you receive the item?""*
 1. Under *""Reason for refund request""*, select *""Logistics Tracking Problem""* and then select *""Purchase Protection is running out, but package is still in transit""*
 1. Write some BS message and click submit
 1. Wait until the seller accepts the dispute and refunds you. If not, then no worries, just wait a bit longer and Aliexpress will return the money for you. 
 1. Regarding the latter, if Aliexpress judges the dispute as invalid, just wait. DO NOT cancel the dispute. Basically it's telling you that you submitted the dispute too early. Later on, Aliexpress will try again and refund you.


Though it may seem like a tedious process, especially since you can only request for a refund after two months, it's honestly the most effective and reliable way of getting a refund. Since there is no tracking info, sellers cannot know whether the item has arrived or not, so they have no choice but to assume that you are telling the truth. I am personally guilty of using this dirty tactic for quite some time.

**IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE:** Both eBay and Aliexpress have a limited time window for requests/disputes. I'm not too sure for eBay, but for Aliexpress, you still have 15 days to open a dispute after purchase protection has run out.

ULPT: Effective Way to Cheat on Finals as a Disabled Student. College addition.,"Been doing this for years. My favorite ULPT for effectively cheating when in college is if you are enrolled into your uni's Disabled Students Program for whatever reason (ADHD/Anxiety/Dyslexia/etc) you get a separate exam location accommodation but are required to put your backpack away from you. It's relatively easy to be diagnosed with something on the emotional/mental spectrum by a doctor and have it processed into your college. Conceal your phone/cheat sheet in the bathroom (I put it behind the lining of the stall's feminine hygiene containers or tape it to the bottom of the toilet with carpenters blue tape. Pretend you have a migraine/look unwell/hold your stomach in pain (if you want to be super extra, have an ice/heat pack you keep to your head/stomach/etc). When you make frequent bathroom visits, they wont question it. This will give you an edge to questions you are stuck on during the final.

I also get leniency on late assignments, and tend to switch sections a lot with no repercussions by reaching out to the professor and upping my pity play of my inability to get work done because of health reasons (you don't have to legally disclose anything to them other than you being a Disabled Students Program member that is incapacitated with a mention of your ""consideration of health"" accommodation, if you don't want to be creative).

ULPT: Request. Need to get this property manager targeting us off our backs,"We’re unit owners in a condo managed by what our neighbors call her “hitler”. Micromanages and targets us and our cars. Sorry in advance that this will be more rant-y.

Since they cannot pin anything in our unit, her and her little elfish misfits are targeting our cars in the shared garage lot. Despite having our make, model, license on file. they have odd rules where are parking stickers with a sticky back have to be placed on the outside of the car and not from the inside-sticky face (important later). Without it, vehicles are at risk of being towed. 

First off, Residents should not be parking in visitor spots, but most residents do because I SEE THEIR STICKERS on the back of their vehicles and it is prohibited to back into the parking spaces for this exact visibility reasons. But never have i ever witnessed any other residents’ cars getting towed..except you guessed it: me. I guess it was their bylaws so i understood. I still get verbally threatened by her if i even park here for a short time and she sees me from her stupid office.

Another incident where they were power washing the garage. Hung up banners saying if vehicles left in the garage, damages are at owners expense. I saw 25% of cars still in their space while workers power washing/cleaning, no big deal. as i walked to my car to gym since i was actually home for the first time in 3 yrs when this happened.. my car was no where to be found.... the property manager decided to tow it since my sticker was not on the vehicle, damn well knowing its my car whether the stupid sticker was on it or not.. later i find that it was on the floor of my spot. For 3 years: snow, rain, sunshine and chicago wind was not able to cause this parking sticker to ever fall off yet in my quiet garage space, it conveniently did. What was more infuriating was when i called the tow co to verify the reason, the rep said “yes i remember the rude lady, she just said im the PM, please get this piece of sh*t out of my garage cuz its not authorized” 

Really.. Im so fed up with her and her maintenance goonies. Im not sure who else to take this to. The condo is managed by her but under a management company/group. It’s sad that after work, i cannot sleep thinking what if they tow my car for some more bullshit reason. hate to say it but im so glad she’s of that age where she’s dying, forever alone with only her goonies to be the only ones attending her funeral soon and ill be happily alive to know this.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1560183807,bunrateeg,37,16,True,2019-06-10

Waterstones have a loyalty scheme whereby they stamp your loyalty card each time you spend £10. Spend £20 and get two stamps, etc. Once you have 10 stamps you can claim £10 off your next purchase with the loyalty card.

So if you go to Waterstones and spend £100 on books ""for your SO's birthday\*"" ([not hard when there are books at £50, £30 and £20](https://www.waterstones.com/campaign/new-books/sort/bestselling/min_price/20/max_price/50)) you'll get 10 stamps immediately. Your SO then takes the books back to a different Waterstones and gets a full refund after explaining they're an unwanted birthday gift whilst you keep the loyalty card.

At your next trip to Waterstones, you can use the loyalty card to save yourself £10.

Obviously take into account things like dates and times on receipts (don't try this as a next day thing) and check any terms and conditions associated with the loyalty cards - I know Waterstones employees are generally happy to stamp you and will give you a stamp even if your purchase is £9.99, for example.

Below this i am including the same link that you will find googling, but this one gives me $50 for the referal while having no additional positive or negative effects on your $200. The $150 for the savings account it talks about has a bunch of stipulations and I wouldnt really recommend trying to fool with it. Anyway, enjoy! PS I can only get a max of 10 referrals so it would be neat to keep this going and rotating the referral link to whoever is in line next after 10 occur. But I repeat you dont have to use my link if you dont want to. I've gotten five referrals (as of of today 6/7) already and will let you know and edit to a new person's when I get 10!

ULPT: Checking Account Exploit for an EASY $200! (Actionable Tip),"So if you want a super easy $200 for opening a checking account, just Google Chase $200 new checking bonus and it's like the first thing that comes up. The only requirement is a direct deposit which can be tricked if needed. A transfer from Circle Pay I know counts as a direct deposit. After a ""direct deposit"" of any dollar amount (yes, $1 is enough, a penny I am pretty sure would work too but I wouldnt recommend doing it then waiting a week to find out for sure when a single dollar definitely will)

Below this i am including the same link that you will find googling, but this one gives me $50 for the referal while having no additional positive or negative effects on your $200. The $150 for the savings account it talks about has a bunch of stipulations and I wouldnt really recommend trying to fool with it. Anyway, enjoy! PS I can only get a max of 10 referrals so it would be neat to keep this going and rotating the referral link to whoever is in line next after 10 occur. But I repeat you dont have to use my link if you dont want to. I've gotten five referrals (as of of today 6/7) already and will let you know and edit to a new person's when I get 10!

Some juries have also refused to convict due to their own prejudices in favour of the defendant.


Nullification is not an official part of criminal procedure, but is the logical consequence of two rules governing the systems in which it exists:


Jurors cannot be punished for reaching a ""wrong"" decision (such as acquitting a defendant despite their guilt being proven beyond a reasonable doubt).


A defendant who is acquitted cannot be tried again for the same alleged crime in front of another jury.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1559839740,Birdmaan73u,54,47,True,2019-06-06

Long story short: My in-laws have been HORRIBLE. My mother in law is a narcissist cult leader who controls everyone in my husbands family. 6 kids and a husband and they all work for the family business and she controls the money. My husband is the only one that works outside of the family business.

Anyways they decided to hate us after my husband and I got into a fight over a year ago. It was a dumb drunk tiff that we wouldn’t even remember. 

So since then this is what’s happened:
MIL publicly canceled the engagement party for us (after invites were sent to my family and his - well over 50 of our closest friends and family members)
MIL and family didn’t talk to us through wedding planning
Brother proposes to his GF (who MIL used to HATE) but of course they have are SooOooOo happy for them
They make their date 8 weeks after our wedding ( that makes for a 4 month engagement)
MIL throws extravagant engagement party for them and the whole time used it to throw it in our face like “if you’re in you get everything if you’re out you get nothing” - also branded it 2019... our wedding year as well.
MIL got unlimited gifts for brother/fiancé at Christmas and get us nothing while we’re all sitting around the fireplace opening gifts (they love shoving stuff in our face)
during our wedding weekend, MIL throws a family party and doesn’t invite me or my husband (IT WAS A DESTINATION WEDDING) 
Sister, who was a bridesmaid, posted pics about being at the wedding but didn’t include a mention of us and cropped me and my husband out of a picture 
All family left right after dinner, before any wedding stuff like the cake cutting, bouquet toss, reception dancing etc
They haven’t talked to us since

Okay... so now the brothers/fiancé wedding is this weekend. We are going because my husband is the best man. Even though his brother actually fucked us over by proposing to his GF during all of us, my husband wants to be there for him.

So how can I show them we’re better off, we don’t think about them, we don’t care we don’t hate them but with giving them a little punch :)

For example his mom and aunt have had a million procedures done on their faces... I want to ask them if they got their lips done... smile and walk away. But who knows

ULPT What are ways you can communicate with someone privately without anybody else finding out pc or laptop? 📷,"&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to install any apps or programs on my laptop or pc, just would like to know ways where you can contact a person without getting caught by someone who would be spying on you.

I can't use even use emails because they have access to those emails, and all my accounts on my phone so thats not an option. I can't use apps on my phone because it will be traced last time I used it and also if you share images or media on a phone no matter if you delete it , there are backdoor ways to retrieve files that are deleted unless you do a factory reset every single time.

Only options

1. use a burner phone and never use home network wifi and never login into known accounts that the person spying knows - I don't feel like doing this right now

2) Is there any websites that I can chat that wouldn't require a a software to be downloaded where I can share images and pictures or video chat without the person spying knowing what I am doing? I will use a vpn , but a vpn is pointless if all your google accounts and email are all accessible to the person spying and you log into those accounts while using the vpn. They can just trace the vpn IP and see what your are doing.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1559780241,BITCOINSWAMI,48,9,True,2019-06-05

However, these systems only read text, no matter the color. So if you write your normal resume, which should have a lot of blank space so that it’s easier to read. But instead of leaving the blank space blank, you add keywords from the job description /requirements that you might not otherwise be able to include in your resume, but in white text in the blank space.

ULPT: This is how you disappear completely,"Hate your job? Hate your wife? Hate your family? Has your meth empire failed and your name is Walter White?
Here is my approved 10 step guide for how to disappear completely:



Do not tell ANYBODY about your disappearances. Do not leave any traces on your internet history of thoughts of disappearance, do not act any differently. Make sure there is no evidence that you even entertained this thought. You already failed by posting this. I failed by writing this.



Decide on a far away place to go to. Use an internet cafe on a spare old laptop or phone which you will destroy upon researching. Use the strongest and most secure VPN possible.



Decide on how you wish to travel to your new location. I suggest not going with plane, as cameras are plenty and you could be seen on the footage, and payments are done with cards that are traceable and you cannot use cryptocurrency. Take out 10 bucks cash every day for a while, until you stash up around 1k or more, as much as you need to travel and get started up. Taking out 1k at once will be extremely suspicious, 10 bucks looks like a cigarette addiction.



Pick a new identity. Do not bother falsifying evidence and new documents, you won't be able to afford that or do it successfully enough to matter. Get a new name. Don't pick a name you like, pick one you hate. Don't use usernames you used in the past, characters of your favourite shows or fiction, all of these could be used to narrow you down. Pick a name nobody would think you actually would name yourself, make sure it has no meaning whatsoever and make it believeable. Don't be Walter White, be John Smith



Do not pack anything with you besides the things you regularly take to work. Phone, wallet and the clothes you were wearing, maybe a backpack. Nothing more. Shred or destroy all of your cards and dispose of them somewhere safe. Leave no trace in your house that you left with intent



Decide your day of disappearance. Make it a day where you have the most time to disappear. A day you usually work more hours on, or a day that your spouse or parents are telling you they might stay later at work. The more hours you have before being reported gone, the higher the likelihood of success.



Right before leaving, get a drastic change in appearance. Buy some new, cheap clothes that are inconspicuous on the day of disappearance. Blue jeans, black tshirt, baseball cap. Something everyone wears. Get your head shaved clean or a buzzcut at the cheapest barber around. Somewhere where you can do it with for 10 bucks or less, and are unlikely to care who you are or have many cameras of good quality. Buy an 8 pack of redbulls and place them in your backpack. Get rid of your phone right before you get in your first taxi. Make sure it was on airplane mode the whole day with the sim card out. Buy a burner phone with some credit, you might need it for access to internet briefly.


Disappear. Travel by taxi only. Use as many as possible, do not take long journeys as taxi drivers will remember them. Make sure to use more shady looking taxis, as these are less likely to have cameras. Travel at night where you are less likely to be traced. Take taxis in as straight of a direction as possible. Do not take long detours, the further away you get in a short as time as possible the more successful you will be. Do not stop at a single place to sleep for the first 2 days, as you could be caught on a camera, asked for ID when wanting to pay for the stay. Drink your energy drinks in the back of your taxis to stay awake. Bring a book or something for entertainment, it will be a long journey



Once you travelled for 2 days, find somewhere to sleep. A sleeping bag in a park or forest, the dirtiest motel you can find, whatever.



Once at your destination, sleep rough for a while. Try to get a dodgy no-ID job. Claim you are an immigrant who learnt English but has no papers whatsoever. Work without paying tax. Once you get enough cash in hand, don't rent out a place. Buy a small RV or something, you will have to sleep rough for quite a while. Try your best to go on until you get enough money and get in contact with someone at your workplace that can help you make a fake set of IDs. You will probably find one as everyone else at your workplace will be cash in hand workers who are probably immigrants",UnethicalLifeProTips,1559506812,alfatems,0,1,True,2019-06-02
"ULPT: Sick of price gougers on old stuff for the sake of 'collection purposes'? Pay through Paypal, then file a dispute saying you did not receive the item as was described. Paypal has fairly incredibly buyer protection.","Thanks to a recent 'boom' in the past ten or so years of 'retro' things having stored value, there is a larger 'reseller' community that goes about buying everything available to then sell at prices that only exist, because they're buying solely to resell.

A common way around this is to buy your item online and do it through Paypal. Make sure you have proof of the sellers item condition, among other things. 

When you receive the item, you have a few options. Most easily you can 'damage' the actual item (for retro games it could be damaging the box, cartridge, etc). Take an image of the item in comparison to what the person posted, and send a dispute to paypal. 

Due to the nature of items as 'collectors' pieces, anything outside of exactly what was promised results in a fairly easy dispute process. Thanks to these assholes cornering a market purely to drive prices up, it is also easy disputes. 

At worst you're asked to send it back (of which you take pictures of each step of packing it back up), documenting it because you do not 'trust' the seller. Then send back an old junk piece you don't want.

This can result in two things, you get the same boot again or they give you in store credit. Obviously in store credit is the better of the two options. It really boils down to the store. 

As to defect out the Gore-Tex, it’s gonna need to leak. To do that, carefully poke holes as far forward in the toes of one boot/shoe or the pair. One would create less suspicion. Poking holes will be better since doesn’t leave as much of a visible appearance like cutting will. 

In order to test the Gore-Tex, lots of places fill the boots full of water to see if they leak, therefore water will escape from the holes and prove they are defective.

ULPT Request: Overcharge My Apple Watch Battery,"I bought a Series 2 Apple Watch in April 2017 with AppleCare+. Last week the battery started to drain super fast and then a few days later the whole thing just died. It’s a month past the two-year extended warranty coverage, but I took it in to the Apple Store to see if they could do anything for me. 

No luck. The technician offered to send it off for repair...for $230. That’s not an option for me right now. I asked about the battery replacement extended warranty on the Series 2 watches and the tech told me the watch only qualifies if the battery shows signs of swelling, like the screen separating from the chassis. 

So how do I force the battery to overcharge so it swells? 

I would love to just go drop $500 on a new watch, but it will take me 3-4 months to save that kind of scratch. I had already been planning to buy a new one when they are released later this year, but going without it for that long kind of terrifies me. 

This device has been a godsend for me over the last two years. It has helped me get my life in order. I’m severely ADHD and the watch has served as a second brain for me, reminding me when to pay bills, setting alarms to remember my medication and when to leave to pick up my kid from school. I use it to set alarms to wake me up in the morning and in the last two years, I’ve not missed a single call from my kid’s school because the watch lets me know when they are calling (he is autistic and has behavioral issues). 

So again, how do I make the battery swell so that I can get it replaced under the battery warranty? When I put it on the charger it gets hot, but it doesn’t appear to be doing anything as far as swelling goes. Would plugging it in and putting it out in the sun do anything? Freezing it? Yeah, it’s unethical, but I’m desperate here and looking for options.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1559243321,27cardmonte,4,6,True,2019-05-30

\- Purchase an inexpensive item(s) on the same transaction as the withdraw to ensure a variable transaction total. 

\- Frequently change the miscellaneous purchase(s) to avoid patterns.

\- Ensure you have an easily explainable habit. For example, buying snacks for the work week on Monday mornings. 

\- Avoid using loyalty cards in case the other party has access to transaction history.

Once night falls you can pretty much pick and choose which animals to steal.  I've got 4 zebras and a macaque.  The macaques getting a bit lonely though, so I might go pick up a couple common wombats.  Unsure where to keep most of your pets?  Build enclosures with simple scrap materials you can find at any junkyard.  There are guides online which can teach you and it will be a good memory for you and your friends or even you and your macaque.  Once you're done, you'll likely have discovered the joy of animal maintenance, but will begin to wonder if they are truly comfortable in their small enclosures.  Convert your house into larger spaces for them, and fill excess space with new and improved animals periodically.  People will of course want to come and enjoy the beautiful fauna, and now you probably can charge a small fee to help you pay for the food and habitats and health of the animals.  Surprise, friend, you're now the proud owner of a zoo, and those alligators you couldn't afford?  Well what zooowner can't afford a couple of alligators.

If you want your paper to be undetectable on Turnitin or other websites of that nature there are three things you can do

&amp;#x200B;

You can switch the languages of your paper so English to Spanish, Spanish to Italian, Italian to Russian, Russian back to English. Once finished you can put it into a paraphrasing generator and its good from there

&amp;#x200B;

The second way is you can change your text into a english like font and it does show up detectable

ULPT request - how to keep someone from breaking into my jeep,"As stated, it's a Jeep - so you unzip the window and you can unlock the door. Fortunately I don't leave anything in there for this exact reason, but my neighbors have had stuff stolen from their unlocked cars as well. 

Every few weeks someone comes by to rummage through it. I've filed police reports, put up cameras and lights, but they keep coming back. I'm at the point where I want to camp out in a bush with a firearm.

 This time I want to make sure they get something.

I've tried 3d printing nail spikes (and let them rust for a while) and putting them around the vehicle but I'm affraid to leave them out because of lawnmowers and kids. my next project will to be printing inserts for the door handle that hold razor blades and open wires connected to the battery.

"ULPT REQUEST: how do I destroy my old laptop, but not leave a trace?","Backstory: I have this pretty old HP laptop from almost 10 years ago (it was my moms' old work laptop) but when she got a new one about 5 years ago, she gave that one to me. about 2 years into me having it, the laptop basically crapped out and formatted itself loosing ALL of her work documents. I had it for about 2 years after that. She never found out because she never needed it. No big deal. Fast forward to about two days ago. parently there's 1 document on there that she needs for some reason (she hasn't specified what it was) but now she wants to turn the computer back on. Keep in mind, my mother is the least understanding person I know, and if she thinks something happened, it happened... whether or not it actually did. The only thing preventing her from turning it on is that she can't find the charger (which I have). but anyways to sup it up, whats one way I can break the laptop (clearing all the data) she when/if she takes it into the shop, they can't recover anything?

I've thought of pouring water on it, but it's pretty clear to see water damage when you open up electronics.

Another thing I thought of is pounding on the hard drive until it fucks itself. I know this is possible because I accidentally did this one time on my new laptop, and I lost all my data.

ULPT - Sleep with a girl way out of your league by pretending to be super rich,"Could be classed as illegal or unethical. I'm trying this tonight with a girl.

Go on Instagram and find a girl you think is really hot and near to you. This could be someone you vaguely know of in your area or you may discover her on Instagram by typing in the name of the town you live in on the search section and then going to the tab called ""places"" so it shows people who tagged your area when they took a photo and then identify the hot girl/guy you want to sleep with. 

Next, slide into their DMs. Private message them saying something like ""keep this between you and me but do you want a sugar daddy"". Or you could say ""Keep this between you and me but I'll pay you $500 to sleep with you"". 

She may reply no, she may seem interested but skeptical (very promising sign basically means yes but she doesn't want to sound too keen/like she's that sort of person, or she may flat out say yes. 

You might want to create a second Instagram account for doing this ILPT just so you don't build up a dodgy rep.

She's probably going to want proof that you're as rich as you're claiming to be so next, log onto your online banking through your phone and screenshot how much money you have on there. Then email this screenshot to yourself.

Log onto a computer/PC/laptop, go on your emails, open up this screenshot on your computer and go onto Microsoft Paint (or photoshop if you can use it but you can use Paint if you're not so good with technology). 

Say you have €864 in your bank account, on Paint highlight the ""8"" and click copy then paste and stick it in the front so it'll now say $8864 then copy one of the 4's and paste it into this number so it may say ""$84864"" and you may want to copy and paste one more number or try to add a new number such as a 0 so it looks more legit/genuine e.g. $840864"" or jumble around the number so it doesn't look like a sequence. If you're on an iPhone you may also want to change the time at the top of the screen to what the current time is so when you send the screenshot to the girl it looks like you've just screenshotted it rather than something sent several hours ago.

Then say to her we can get a hotel and you'll pay her. You may need to take her on a proper date too e.g. Dinner or drinks so she trusts you. I recommend drinks - will explain why below. Then when you get to the hotel, sleep with her and spend the night there. In the morn if she's had enough to drink she'll be a bit hungover and maybe smelly. When she's in the shower, quietly find her purse in the hotel room, take the $500 out of her purse and make a quick but quiet exit (even if she hears she won't run down the hotel in her towel she will need to get dressed). 

You would've paid for the hotel and possibly dinner/drinks but not the $500. Of course there's a small risk she may not have a shower, may take the money into her bathroom with her.  If you can build trust/rapport that you're rich she may let her guard down a bit. If she doesn't have a shower, make sure dinner is something that's going to make her need a poo so she's on the toilet for a while and use this as an opportunity to make a quick getaway.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1558776079,dylantombides,7,0,True,2019-05-25

ULPT Request: Accidentally broke TV in hotel room...,"I just moved across the country for a new job and am pretty much going to be broke until I get my first paycheck in a couple of weeks. Last night, perhaps the **dumbest** thing that has ever happened to me happened.. I haven't made any friends here yet (third day here), so I've been aimlessly killing time in my hotel room. I came across a superball as a prize in an arcade, and haven't seen those in probably 10+ years so I had to have it. Well, I made the grossly unintelligent decision of bouncing it in my room, and the first fucking bounce it took went off of a wall and hit square in the middle of the 40"" flatscreen (or plasma?) in my room. 

It wasn't on and I haven't even turned it on yet, but my fears came true as I turned it on and the LCD is completely fucked. When it's turned off you can't tell in any way that the TV is screwed up. 

I'm checking out on Sunday, and I looked up the value of the TV and it's roughly $500 somehow.. 

Is this something the maids would check when cleaning and readying the room for the next people? I imagine one of two scenarios happen here:

1. The maid turns on the TV while cleaning to either make sure it's not damaged or for entertaining while (s)he cleans, sees it's fucked, and reports it, or 
2. The next people to use the room turn on the TV, see it's fucked, and report it to the hotel

In either scenario I assume I'll be blamed (and billed), so what is my best unethical course of action here? I've considered going to the front desk and saying I haven't used the TV yet but just turned it on to find out oops someone before me broke it, but since I've been here for a few days I assume they'll call bullshit.

"ULPT Request: Retroactively ""hire"" me as a technical consultant","Short version: I'm looking for a some who is or can believably pass for a US based technology manager (or above) to claim that I worked for your company as consultant (1099 contractor). This person will need to respond to reference requests received by phone or email as needed for up to 4 months. In exchange, I will pay you a retainer and perform a similar white lie service for you if needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**About me:** I'm a Professional Scrum Master and Product/Project Manager. Those statements are objectively true. I have the skills and PSM I certificate to prove it. Unfortunately, my recent work experience doesn't reflect my capabilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago I was working in a technology implementation manager role (with a shittier title, of course) for a professional services company. The sales team continually lied about the company's technology offerings, including to the client for what ended up being my last project. Instead of actually funding the solution they promised this client, they tried to force me to travel to the client's HQ every other week (50%+ travel) to manage the relationship (read: lie, lie and lie some more). The stress, hours and work environment were killing me, so I resigned. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I would find another job quickly, but I live in a somewhat rural area and was hit with a series of unfortunate events. Several employers ghosted me at the offer stage. Several more offered me jobs with terrible pay. (The worst offer was less than $13/hr.) One consulting firm hired me and let me go after just one day due to an oversight on their part. The longer this went on the more depressed I became. Eventually I had to stop looking for full-time jobs and just make some money, which is what I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the bulk of the freelance work I've done in the past 3 years has been writing. I need to move back to a more stable line of work with benefits, so I've been taking steps to make that happen including learning some new skills, getting my PSM certification, etc. The challenge I'm facing is that I don't have a recent position that demonstrates my most marketable skill sets. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I'm looking for**: I need a US based technology manager or someone who can convincingly play one to serve as a professional reference. Since I have documented experience as a freelancer, I think it makes since to say that I was hired as a remote-based consultant on a specific longer-term project. The reason I'm no longer working for your company is because the project ended. The reason that they can't just call the office for a verification is because I was a contractor, not an employee.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm aware of services like Career Excuse, their reviews make me question whether they actually perform the service they promise. I decided not to ask a friend to do this because anyone I'd be comfortable asking could be easily identified as a close friend of mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm offering $100 USD and one similar white lie to serve as my reference for up to 4 months. I'm a pretty good interviewer and already have some interviews lined up next week, so hopefully this won't take that long.

&amp;#x200B;

**Requirements:**

* Fluent English speaker (I'm not prejudiced, but a lot of employers are.)
* Work experience in an IT related position
* US phone number
* Professional email address
* Willingness to use your real name
* Ability to respond to requests within 1-2 business days
* Willingness to sign a NDA
* Ability to improvise and redirect conversations when necessarily

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of legality, I'm not applying for any government positions or with any organizations that would perform a comprehensive background check. My fake reference will be one of three or more total references with all of the others being legit, so I'm not relying on a lie to carry my entire application.

&amp;#x200B;

I typically have to pass some type of skills test before even being offered an interview, so you know that I can back up anything I ask you to say. I'm also willing to meet with prospective references via phone or web conference (after signing a NDA, of course) if you'd like to vet me before agreeing.

ULPT: PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE TACTIC,"I've had a few jobs where Hispanic people made up the majority of the workforce.  To be more specific, a lot of these Hispanic people were new citizens or were/are working on becoming citizens.  Most of them could hardly speak any English.  

At most of the jobs like this, I noticed that a lot of the employees would throw away their used toilet paper in the trash can...  It's disgusting IMO, but I've been told that they do that as ""instinct.""  Apparently the plumbing is very bad where their originally from, so to try and reduce how much goes through the pipes they throw their used toilet paper in the trash can instead of flushing it.  If anything, they're actually trying to help the company out in a way by reducing the chance of clogging the toilet 🤷🏽‍♂️ In some cases however, it's an act of sabotage...

At this new temporary job I got, an employee gave me a new perspective on the issue.  A lot of employees are unhappy with their job, but they can't find much work with the hours like what they get from this company.

ULPT: Eat for Free in any Restaurant,"I've been reading through this subreddit recently, and it's reminded me of a way of making the famous, 'dine and dash', a lot easier.

Things you'll need; an accomplice, and an Alka-Seltzer, or other effervescent tablet.

If you decided you want to try this, which I obviously don't recommend, here's what you do.

Make your reservation at the restaurant you want to eat.  Show up at the correct time, well dressed, and park around a corner away from the restaurant.  Walk in, order your food and eat as per usual, until it comes time for the dessert.  You can either pull the trick before or after your dessert, but ideally you want to act while your waiter is still expecting to bring you something, even an after meal coffee.  This way it doesn't look *too* suspicious.

I'm guessing most of you will have already figured out what to do, but incase you haven't, all you need to do is slip the Alka-Seltzer into your mouth, and let it start to effervesce.  When it does, start dribbling the resulting foam out of your mouth, clutching your heart, or your throat, having your accomplace 'help' you up and straight out the door.  Have them help you all the way to the car, get in, and drive away, marking the restaurant off your list of establishments you can pull the stunt at in the future.

Note:  you need to be careful to dribble all of the foam out of your mouth, and pretty much as quickly as it forms, because you don't want to block your airways with the foam.  For this reason it's also sensible to use as little Alka-Seltzer as needed, half a tablet, one at the most.  Although, again, I suggest you *do not* actually try this.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1558364263,DrFeelFantastic,3,0,True,2019-05-20

They do well with structure, so demand multiple selfies a day. Offer to ""help"" them, require they send you pictures of everything they eat, and criticize them for it. After only a few days, they'll be willing to send you nude ""check-ins"" so you can monitor their bodies. Have them give you full access to their MyFitnessPal (they all use it).

When you do meet in person and fuck them, be sure to criticize their bodies. That's what they need to fuel their obsessions, you're just giving them what they want.

When they suck your dick, be sure to show them the ""cum"" entry in MyFitnessPal, and tell them at least one day a week that's the only calories they're allowed to eat. They love structure and control and being told what to do.

Warnings:

* They get clingy really easily. This sounds cool and like a lot of fun, but when they blow up your phone because you don't respond to them for a couple of hours it can be annoying.

* They'll definitely cheat on you, they're the ""low hanging fruit"" of the dating world, and other men know how to manipulate them too.

* Use condoms, and don't let them ever know your full real name, where you work, or where you live. They're definitely the type to go batshit crazy obsessive, so have your lies lined up.

* Most of them are into DD/LG because they have daddy issues. If you're not comfortable with a girl calling you ""Daddy,"" this isn't the path for you.

Below this i am including the same link that you will find googling, but this one gives me $50 for the referal while having no additional positive or negative effects on your $200. The $150 for the savings account it talks about has a bunch of stipulations and I wouldnt really recommend trying to fool with it. Anyway, enjoy! PS I can only get a max of 10 referrals so it would be neat to keep this going and rotating the referral link to whoever is in line next after 10 occur.

ULPT: Using a certain chrome extension can give you a linkable version of a fake website,"Ever needed to change something on a website (for whatever reason) to make it look believable?

 I used this method to create a static web page of my college grades, I gave myself all 100’s and created a link and when I clicked on the link, you would be directed to a page that would look exactly like the original, only difference is you would not be able to interact with, any sort of button or tab will not work when clicked on, so this is visual only, however I still think the possibilities for this are endless. Here are the steps:

1) download a chrome extension called sitemod.io, then go to the page you want to modify

2) inspect element on the page 

3) click on the sitemod extension

4) in the top right there is a plus sign, click it

5) click create new fork

6) edit whatever you want to the page in the source code

7) when you are done (with inspect element still open) click save fork

8) now this “fork” is saved and if you go to a new tab and click on the fork, under the sitemod extension, you will be redirected to the page you just modified. 

9) and if you want, you can copy and paste the chrome link at the top of the browser and now you are able to link this modified static page and send it to whomever



I think there are great unethical possibilities for this, one I’m thinking of is using this method to change prices on Walmart or other stores websites by a small margin, 10 or so dollars, and showing it to an employee in the store on your phone, since it’s a web page and not a screenshot, they will be able to zoom in, etc.

Usually when I say, “on the website it’s listed as X price and in store it’s more expensive, can I get the website price” as long as it looks legit enough they don’t give it a second thought, just make sure they don’t try to navigate the page because none of the actual buttons/tabs/menus etc work.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1558139752,nicksabanscokebottle,0,1,True,2019-05-17

ULPT: Eat Free KFC For A Year Claiming You're From Head Office,"Just do this!

&gt; #**Man Arrested After Eating Free KFC For A Year Claiming He's From Head Office**

&gt; We've all got a mate who's gone back around the drive-thru, claiming an item has been 'missed' from their order even though it's most definitely right in front of them - only be met with a polite apology before receiving a substitute for said 'missing' item (and sometimes an extra portion of chips to soften the blow).

&gt; But what one 27-year-old fella did was quite close to genius - only it just missed the mark because he has now been arrested and will appear in court after allegedly scamming his way to eating free at KFC for an entire year.

&gt;The South African man is reported to have told employees of the fast food chain that he had been sent from the KFC headquarters for quality checks to make sure the chicken was up to standard.

&gt; According to India Today, the University of KwaZulu-Natal student would walk in with confidence and tell staff he was there for quality assurance checks of the food served in the restaurant.

&gt; It has also been reported that the unnamed man carried an ID card from 'head office' and would dress very smart - even arriving in a limousine. Credit where credit's due, that's dedication.

&gt;Well, according to Xpouzar, the man's friend is a part-time limo driver and seemed to be a pretty good alleged accomplice for pretending you're a man with status, by the sound of things.

&gt; A member of staff from KFC told Xpouzar: ""When he arrived we would all try to act our best so that we didn't piss off the man from head office - he was so convincing because he was so confident, and even colleagues from other branches of KFC know him.

&gt;""When he came in, he rushed to the kitchen and checked everything, taking notes and then asked for samples of whatever he wanted. He probably worked for KFC before because he knows everything.""

&gt; The story was shared on Twitter by a Kenyan journalist who tweets from an account called 'The African Voice'.

&gt; The post currently has 22,000 likes and 10,000 retweets with people dubbing the KFC impostor a 'hero'.

&gt; One person commented: ""They should give that man that job already."" Another added: ""Not all heroes wear capes..""

&gt; A third person wrote: ""He is a legend and is now very experienced taster. KFC should employ him.""

&gt; An almost flawless plan... until he inevitably got caught. Unlucky, mate.

"ULPT: Want a nice cut of meat at a deep discount? Dispute the price at the checkout; they legally cannot re-shelve/sell the food now, and would rather give a discount than throw it out.","**My Experience:**

Last night grocery shopping w my husband and kiddo, he wanted to make beef stroganoff from scratch and picked up a really nice looking beef kebab loin (?? something like that), from an organic brand that we really like to buy when it’s on sale - the sign said it was $6.79. 

When we get to the checkout, I’m bagging groceries and entertaining kiddo while husband deals w the cashier, and he stops her when the meat rings up at $13.99, saying it was supposed to be $6 something and he’s positive about that. She does the whole “call someone to go check the price”, and while waiting, a meat department worker happens by. She calls out to him and asks if he knows the price off the top of his head (to save the other person a trip). Meat Guy tells Cashier, “Welp, it’s .99 now!” in a way that we weren’t sure if he was joking or not - so cashier kinda laughs and goes “Wait, really?” 

Meat Guy’s like, “Yeah, we can’t re sell it now...” and they lowered their voices so we couldn’t hear the rest - but I know general grocery store policy in the US, and I realized that we were unintentionally taking advantage of a loophole in that moment. 

Sure enough, the cashier went ahead took the amount off our total, and entered “0.99” as a miscellaneous charge. (Well actually she kinda messed it up so the manager had to give us $14 cash back but that’s not really the point). 

________

**Why It Works:**

I can only speak for the US, but the law requires grocery stores to dispose of any meat, dairy, or other bacteria-prone refrigerated items that have been in someone’s chopping cart for an indeterminate length of time (aka everyone). They cannot re sell products safely to the public that are refrigerated and have been outside of refrigeration for any length of time. This does lead to massive food waste in the interest of public health, and this ULPT is aimed to take a little advantage of that.

I would still travel to NV every few months so it wouldn't be tough to keep my DL or register my car (will be tough to get the smog check though, would have to drive to NV each year), I'm guessing you pay income tax per which state you have your DL in?

ULPT: Getting some Extra food from Panera Bread!," 

I used to work at Panera Bread a long time ago in the salad bar before I quit. I began to notice that there are some different regulars who always do this:

1. Ask for a piece of bread at the cashier and wait for the cashier to ring your order. Wait for your food and then when you are called, pick your plate up, pretend to take it for a few seconds and come back to the counter saying that you asked for an apple or a chip and have told the cashier to change it earlier. The employee will give you an apple or a chip and let you keep the bread as their policy is, they are not allowed to take food back after it leaves the counter. You can now enjoy 2 sides instead of one.
2. There is this regular couple that comes every weekend on lunch, the busiest time ever that stresses me out in the kitchen. They always ask for a bowl of soup, ate it up and then come back, asking for a manager and saying that they're disappointed with the taste. They asked politely though, and ask if they can change it to another soup. They did not get a refund, but they do get another bowl of soup.
3. The last one is the best for me in a customer's POV. This lady ordered a salad online and makes a lot of typos on her notes. I made her salad the way it should be made. When she arrives she checks it and said ""I'm sorry, but I put a note that I don't want this in my salad. I'm in a hurry, can you please fix it fast?"". Well as you have guessed, I don't want to be bothered to take out the ingredients she doesn't want (In this case, it's poppyseeds and bacon after I shake them). So I just make a new batch of salad. I let her keep the salad that I made before because it is our policy to let the customer keeps the wrong order, we are going to throw them away anyway since we, the employees, are not allowed to take it home. I took a break after that and I caught her eating the salad in the dining area.
4. This one is not really a tip, but if you ever need a free Wi-Fi, Panera Bread is the best place. You don't really have to buy anything at all, you can just come and sit everywhere you want from morning time till they are closing. If you are thirsty you can come to the cashier and ask for a cup, they won't question you anything and will just give it to you. You get a free drink and Wi-Fi which is a win-win situation. And since you asked the cashier, it is technically not stealing. You still might need to eat though, but you can buy food from outside the store and come back since Panera Bread menu is absurdly overpriced. No one will dare to ask you to leave as long as you are not making any commotions.

That is all my Unethical Life Pro Tips that I can share with my experience working in Panera Bread for 3 years. It has been a while since I left Panera, it is a great place to start. I speak French, so please excuse my grammatical error. I personally don't count any of these tips as stealing, because you do ask them and they have the rights to say no; it is also a tip that takes advantage of their policies.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1557786247,Black_seraph,3,10,True,2019-05-13

"ULPT: if you are failing university or college and your student debts are piling on, go to a psychiatrist to get diagnosed for ADHD. Psychiatrist don't do the intensive testing that psychologist do but will give you the diagnosis needed to reduce your loan and give you the benefit of being disabled.","I did this recently and oh my God, has it helped me so much. I don't actually have ADHD, it's just that my program is tough, I have poor time management skills and friends from different programs that are mostly free anytime of the day. I got an ultimatum from the Ontario Student Assistance Program to put up 10k or else for not following their rules about passing courses. I did meet my University's gpa to stay in the program so they don't care.

 I did my research managed to book an appointment with a psychiatrists and psychiatrist don't do the intensive paperwork and assessments that psychologist do which is why I choice a psychiatrist. Also, they are covered by the Ontario health insurance plan and all private insurance also cover some cost of visiting a psychiatrist, so you American folks can use this trick. It's pretty easy to do the assessment, like legit it's do easy just do your research and know what to say. I got a prescription for Adderall on the second appointment and an official letter from the psychiatrist within a week. Gave it to OSAP and the ultimatum was removed. Also gave me alot of advantages like extra time on assignments being handed in, extra exam time, reduced passing course load requirement to get OSAP, Disability funding, and some other minor benefits. Plus you also get Adderall!!!!


How are you gonna possibly get caught? Even if you tell someone and they snitch on you, you could act depressed and saying that you didn't want the other person to believe you have a mental health issue as it has stigma surrounding it. Even if you were a smart student during highschool, you will still be able to get a diagnosis if you do your research and plan on what to say. Visit r/ADHD and you will hear tons of stories of people being diagnosed when being doing their PHd, Masters, being 50+ and being generally very smart. 

If you are unfortunately and get into the hands of a psychologist, don't worry. Its the same process but they give you more paperwork to complete with your parents (which can also be you if you know what I m saying. That's what I did) and they ask for more detail encounters with your difficulties. They do this because it's more work for them and they get to charge you more for it even those it's all easy. Here in Ontario, the rate is 2000 dollars for an ADHD testing. Just get the paperwork, DONT GO THROUGH WITH THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAM AS IT IS ALSO EXPENSIVE. They are just there to make money off of you and they can't write you medications as they are psychiatrists.

When you get off work and come *home* (to your storage unit) you enter your unit  and stay there until it is time for your partner to start work. Then he, dressed the same as you so it appears that you are leaving, then locks you in for the day while you sleep and quietly live there until he gets off work to replace you.

Because the neighbors say they work nights. Which is bullshit. And I hear them up early during the day. I work nights myself and I don’t put that restriction on them.

They’re super loud when I try to sleep and they don’t care at all but if my dog barks (which is very rare) or if I vacuum or drop something they will email the landlord or come stomping up the stairs to yell at me or they’ll slam things around. The landlord isn’t fond of me despite the fact I keep to myself and pay everything in full on time.

"ULPT: How to find the ""Sauce"", ""Album"" or just the context of a picture on the internet","1. Install the extension ""Image Search Options"" for your browser.

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/  
2. Right click the addon, select ""Options"". Leave ""TinyEye"" and ""Google Search"" options be, unclick and clear the rest.  
3. Add the new option ""Yandex"", name: ""Yandex"" , searchUrl: https://yandex.com/images/search?rpt=imageview&amp;img_url=  click the two checkboxes too.  
4. Right click on any image, in the browser context menu select Image Search Options -&gt; All.  
5. If right click is disabled on the website, install Image Downloader: 
Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj open the image in a new window, and repeat step 4 again.  
6. If the image is locally saved, drag it to a browser window and step 4. This won't work because it's not an online image url that the three search engines can work with. Simply use the camera icon image uploader on google, tinyurl, yandex to upload it from local.  
7. If you would like to find the source of a video, freeze the frame and take a screenshot. Search this like in step 6.  


What to do once you have searched the image. 

Google: Can't find similar images, but finds context well. May even find the instagram etc of the person searched. You are more likely to find a name on the first page, or a lot of pinterest/twitter/tumblr spam pages without any help. Any xhamster album that says ""X girl (40 photos)"" is a good lead.  

TinyUrl: Meh.  

Yandex: Great at finding similar images, or even images from the same album. Very bad at context. If you don't see a name or xhamster album on the first page of results, click the other IMAGE RESULTS, and search through them, or click ""search for similar images"" underneath to the right of image preview. Don't forget to set shield setting to ""Unsecure"" on right top to see more ""NSFW"" photos. 


Post source/album in comments. Reap karma. Everyone's happy. 

To be safe, when you find the age of the person, type ""xx age"" in google, if you find anything that's younger than 18, don't post album or else you will have distributed child porn. Even if she produced it and shared online, you will get in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

A girl got me a dressing room and did not check through my clothes.

I concealed in my bag and hid the hangers in a sweatshirt I had tried on. When I got out of the dressing room the store was dead and no one was around, so an employee stopped me as soon as I stepped out of the dressing room to take the clothes. She took the hoodie with the rest of the clothes, and the girl at check out called me over asking if I was ready. I went to go and purchase an item (Which I could not conceal because of a censor) and I saw the first employee going through the items to put them back. I paid with card, and left without any trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

They now have my name and am positive they found the empty hangers, but no security footage or hard evidence. The items I stole add up to less than $40

The run in with the power tripping manager

&amp;#x200B;

I was walking around minding my own business with my Rump is stupid shirt on, amzn.to/2IFv6Mk when a janitor stops me and asks me for a minute of my time.  He says that I had to change my shirt and asked if I was open to it, I said sure.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who finds that shirt anything other than a funny tribute I typically won’t give my money to.  If you want to tell your kid that the shirt is a curse word instead of stupid, that’s on your parenting skills not on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

A section manager comes next and she says she has to call someone over. The area manager shows up, he calls another manager over, this ones the day manager.  He says that I can’t have on my shirt and suggests that I could flip my shirt inside out.  No i'm not doing that and I ask for my money back so I could go home.  After all this was a spontaneous trip after seeing space X launch it's BFR I thought hey, disney will be just as cool, damnit elon, damn you, lol.  He says no.  I counter offer, I should have let him counter offer, a shirt from one of their shops.  He says no, he was insistent that I flip my shirt inside out.  Then I suggest a Minnie van back to my hotel room and I’ll get another shirt from my suit case and return to the park.  He then decides I can have a shirt from one of the shops, I ask him for ears and he gets really mad.  I never got my ears.  As I’m standing here with who appear to be three managers and security behind me at every point I ask if I could wait somewhere else bc this was embarrassing, no.  so we wait about 5 mins as the park manager storms off to get my shirt.  The next question is would you like a bathroom or changing room.  I didn’t reply. So he repeated himself, he didn’t like that.  who would chose a bathroom over a changing room?  So I changed my shirt and come out.  I had asked to leave the park bc I really needed a drink a smoke at this point and I didn’t realize it involved being escorted out.  I ask to be escorted out the back way they said no so we proceeded to leave the gift shop.  Before I did I stopped to connect my phone to a charger and grab a cigarette bc if I was going to be walked out it was going to be on facebook and I was going to need a cigarette as soon as I got to a smoking section.  One of the guys surrounding me saw this and thought better.

&amp;#x200B;

So we get in the back and the area manger takes the keys to a security van and I’m in the front seat getting the back stage tour.  We get to guest services and the managers go inside and come back out for my id.  I had asked for a park hopper at some point so I could go to another park. No.  He reloaded my card with a single ticket and presented with a taxi voucher and I was on my way.  

&amp;#x200B;

While I’m in the cab, cab drivers suck and this one was no exception, I decided I needed a drink, cabbie wouldn’t do it on the voucher so I had to call an uber.  I mention this bc I came back the next day to get the uber fair back.  

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day I wanted to go back and see if I could get my uber faireback and see if another manager would be less of a prick.  Another park manager approaches me with secuirty.  I explain to him that I didn’t feel like after yesterday’s altercation that Disney wanted me on the park and that I really didn’t want to spend any more money with Disney.  Who has fun on vacation without spending money? Hoping he’d comp me a meal or drinks which I had planned on purchasing but wasn’t going to be doing anymore.  Welp that makes him mad.  After going back and forth for what seemed like 15 mins, being called a liar numerous times, I was told to go into the park or to go to another park that I could not sit on the bench and that I was now deemed a “security threat.” I was texting this to facebook as this was all going down.  I told them that I would finish up a text and be on my way.  As I turn the corner to leave, is the picture in my review.  What you’re seeing is the park manager, two undercover police officers and a orange county sheriffs officer.

ULPT request: making my apartment look new again so my complex doesn’t charge me,"So my lease is up in a month. I need to make my apartment look good enough to where they don’t charge us a huge amount for cleaning. 

Carpets: there’s a few stains. I plan on using stain remover but if that doesn’t work, are there any other carpet cleaning hacks out there? 

Crown molding(and also carpet): so we have a dog that we haven’t told the apartments about because we didn’t wanna pay $600 to have her there for 2 months. She sort of chewed on a corner of the molding by the floor and now the white molding is showing brown wood underneath. It’s not terrrible, but will using a paint marker conceal this? The dog also chewed up some of the carpet by the patio door. We may be able to stick it down with something but there are a few threads missing. Any ideas? 

Walls/doors: so the bedroom door has cracks all in it. I guess it was weak and someone leaned on it. Will white paint marker work to cover those as well? There are some holes from hanging stuff up but there were also plenty of holes when we moved in so I’m not too concerned. The walls are an off white so toothpaste won’t work. 

Blinds: the panel blinds that go over the sliding patio door has a few broken panels. My dad said I could probably get some cheap from somewhere instead of letting them overcharge. Any recommendations? 

Any help is appreciated!",UnethicalLifeProTips,1556566989,ijustneedthisaccount,0,1,True,2019-04-29

ULPT: Missing a few bucks on your amazon prime order to get free one day shipping? Order something cheap that you need and keep it for free.,"Happened to me the other day, I needed something on amazon ASAP, but i did not felt like paying 5 dollars to get the one day shipping, so i just scrolled in my ""saved for later"" basket. I was searching the item that would make my order just over 25$ so i wouldn't have to pay extra for one day shipping and i would still get something that i wanted. It was a small 80mm pc fan, was like 7$. Its a win win for me.

I received my items the next day, as expected. I kept the pc fan to install it where i wanted it a few days later, to notice it was way too loud for my liking, and i wanted to return it. Ofc i could just leave it in my useless pc accessories drawer, but I thought to myselft, meh im a bit tight on cash, Im gonna return it. 

Went on the amazon return page to ask for a refund, i think i said that the item did not fit my expectations and i wanted to return it. Turns out amazon doesnt give a shit about cheap items. They gave me my money back without giving me a return label, and i just get to keep the item. im guessing they do so when generating a printing label and manutention (paying their employees to receive and check the returned item) would cost more than the price of the item itself, they just say to the customer ""hey keep it buddy"".",UnethicalLifeProTips,1556571043,fredhabsfan,7,5,True,2019-04-29

ULPT: Score free food at a busy Chipotle,"YMMV 

Disclaimer: I haven't done this myself but was told this by someone who claims to have done it multiple times and after hearing him I believe it.

So at the local chipotle's around us they throw their online orders that are prepaid on a shelf that's against a wall to the side of and a bit behind the cashier. So for employee to see the shelf they literally have to turn around.

Normally you walk up to the cashier and show your phone or give your name for your online order but when they are slammed they just tell you to check the shelf yourself and grab your food. I have experienced this myself multiples times which is why I believe the story.

My friend says he just walks up grabs a random bag of food and walks right out the store. I've asked him if he is worried about someone checking cameras but he said he only does it every so often and takes precautions like wearing a hat and sunglasses.

ULPT : How to avoid holding babies.," 

The following steps will ensure that no mombie or daddict ever force you to put your arms around their weird  little crotch dumplings.

* When mombie/daddict approaches you with the spawn utter the usual “oooohhh how cute!!!“ bullshit.
* In 99.999% of cases, the dose of bullshit does not satisfy them and the breeders WILL expect you to hold the shit machine.
* Do not panic. At first refuse politely. Hopefully they'll stop asking.
* However if brain damage by baby has rendered mombie/daddict incapable of understanding what the word “no“ means, then pretend to have a coughing fit. And not the polite cute little coughs that make people stroke your back. I'm talking the scary kind. The kind that makes people get the fuck away from so that they don't catch whatever ungodly, straight-from-Satan's-lab virus you're carrying.
* After approximately 3 minutes act as though you've recovered. Tell them you've been sick and don't wish to infect the germ magnet. If they're any kind of sensible they wont let you near their thin sack of organs for a very long time.
* In case if they're critically brain damaged by baby and still insist that you hold the dream killer, cough a few more times. This time, very close to the stomach alien's face. This should be enough to make them back the fuck off.
* However, if they still don't leave you alone, RUN!

"ULPT Request: My family member has to panhandle in order to survive, what are some things she should do in order to get most cash-per-day?"," 

So I have a family member who was drowning in debt, I'm poor myself so I couldn't help her with money, instead I've been trying to help her with the 'how-to', so I told her some tips and so far it's been helpful to her, where we live (a third-world country) you could go to prison for failing to pay debt.

anyway my help included:

1- trying to fake having experience with taking care of elderly people and post that on facebook groups of rich-cities and she managed to get a job that pays higher than her previous sweatshop job that way.

2- panhandling: I was homeless for a while when I was a teenager and panhandling helped me eat and sleep in a relatively safe area, so I told her to try to panhandle, and since she's 45 years old and looks kinda poor, she gets some money from panhandling after leaving her job, but still she gets rejected by most people in the street.

3- trying to act like ""hey, I'm so embarrassed to ask this, but I need 1 pound to take the bus back home, because I lost my purse earlier""or some other variation, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't

So I wanna ask two things, 1- what are some ways to increase the effectiveness of her panhandling strategy?

2- what are some other things that could get her money quickly?

**By the way, since I know that some people will tell me that it's really bad that I'm telling her to do these things, if she doesn't find ways to make money, she'll serve years in a third-world prison, so there's no other way to do it.**

"ULPT: I believe the unethical part may be in me saying this but, there is a really quick a relatively easy way to lose anywhere from 25-75 lbs. in 1-2 months... Adderall.","Stay with me on this one because it's a long one, it takes some work and probably not having a past history of adderall use is a plus. It starts with finding the right doctor, or better yet a nurse practitioner for a doctor. It may take some searching, but if you look for mandated therapists or therapists that serve medicaid you seem to have a bit more luck. It's as simple as saying that you recently started back in school and have been noticing that you haven't been able to get anything task-related done and that you thought you were just a bad student, but you know you study. Most doctors will give you a small extended release dosage to start, which is fine. But if they ask if you've ever been prescribed adderall, say yea but you were really young and just remember it lasting too long and reading too late according to my parents, but you were little. If you get lucky, they may throw some instant release footballs your way, they taste like candy and melt in your mouth. If you can put on a somewhat decent act, you'll be able to walk out of there with your script and since you voiced concern about sleep, might walk out of there with a script for xan as well.

As for the diet part. You will find that the adderall will suppress your appetite by itself, and that combined with well-timed cups of black coffee will get you through any tough parts. But you do need to eat. If you want to do it quick, your daily diet is as follows. (1) bag of baby carrots, (2) apples, (2) bananas, (1/2 cup) almonds, (1/2 cup) whole milk and really any other snacking veg that will get you through the day. Otherwise, alongside a ton of water, that is it.

Excercise. So you will be drastically cutting your calories, but you still need to exercise. This will not work if you don't take at least a bit of effort. Walking as little as 3 miles a day is huge if you haven't done anything before and slowly working your way up as you curve back to a healthier caloric intake.

That's it. It will feel like cheating, because it is. But if you can do it right and you are conscious of what you are doing and how you are feeling. I went from 175-150 over the past month and that was with minimal aggressive exercise. But adderall in the morning, grazing and exercise during the day and if you were lucky, a xan to help a hungry person fall asleep at night.

"ULPT: How to FIRE in your 20's with ~$5,000 a Month Passive Income","**FIRE** = *Financial Independence / Retire Early*

I have watched people here struggle to live a Spartan life style for years to save money in the hope of one day retiring ""young."" In this case retiring ""young"" means in their 40's generally. Many men are going gray or completely bald by age 30 so 45 is hardly ""young"" by any standard. It's past middle age considering the life expectancy is 78 or so for a 45 year old man. People are foregoing marriage, having children, vacations, and enjoying life generally in the hope of one day retiring early and being financially independent. So I have decided to share some real world advice that will help you FIRE as young as possible. I know multiple individuals who have done this and know of many tens of thousands more.

The first step is the hardest - you have to join the U.S. military and compete all of your training until you enter regular service. At least 50% of Americans cannot get accepted to basic training. But if you can your dream of early retirement is just around the corner. The earlier you enlist the earlier you will reach full early retirement (FIRE!). Some have achieved this as early as age 21.

While on Active Duty begin going to sick call continually reporting various aches and pains attributed to military service and training. Knee injuries are good. Better if they are real. You should play sports in order to get injured while on Active Duty. Back injuries are also golden.

However, you can also claim things like erectile dysfunction as a service connected disability. Agoraphobia, depression, PTSD, etc. There are many possibilities here. Just make sure all of this is being documented by military doctors for your Department of Veteran's Affairs claim later.

Despite all your sick calls and injuries, be sure to finish out your enlistment and receive an honorable discharge. Then start going to the VA constantly for both physical and mental ailments. Especially the mental ones because those will get you 100% permanent disability while physical injuries, even received in combat, generally will not.

VA disability money cannot be touched by child support judgments so no worries about fathering children who you will later abandon. But the more children you keep around and do not abandon the more money you will get. You should expect a minimum of $3,400 a month for life with 2 children. Once you receive your 100% permanent disability rating from the VA you can then easily also apply for Social Security disability which will be another $1,400 a month for life. So 4 years of service will net you ~$5,000 a month passive for life.

It's just that easy. FIRE in your 20's like tens of thousands of others before you.

Here are some calculations for you:

 • $5,000 a month is $60,000 a year passive

 • At 1% interest on typical money market savings accounts, you would need $6,000,000 in the bank to achieve this $5,000 a month passive income

 • Assuming you are a man that FIREs using this method at age 21 and live until age 78...

 • Your 4 years of military service are worth ~3.5 Million dollars or approximately $875,000 per year of service

 • But you also get free medical care for life which is worth a couple million more

If I could go back in time as a teen I would follow this foolproof method to early retirement in my 20's so I could enjoy the fabulous life style of those I know who have pursued this retirement strategy. A fabulous FIRE lifestyle such as weighing over 300 pounds, playing World of Warcraft 14 hours a day, fathering numerous bastard children with multiple women, half assedly starting numerous projects that never see completion such as writing a book, learning foreign langauges, finishing college, starting a business, starting a web site, becoming a preacher, or becoming a farmer. The possibilities to fail and waste time are endless once you have the financial freedom to fully utilize your energy towards any random idea that pops into your head.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1556278760,SlashFang,8,27,True,2019-04-26

I've bought an iPhone 8 Plus last year (paid it new 600$ and considering that it cost more than 850 at the time, it was pretty much a deal) and I want it to be replaced by Apple before my AppleCare ends. What could I tell them to be sure that my iPhone gets replaced? I don't want to actually break anything though. Consider that I've already called them telling them that I'm getting a random red/black screen and that my phone overall is slow as fuck and that the apps are always crashing (not true of course). After that I've been asked to tell them the maximum capacity of the battery (at this point I didn't know if I could keep lying or not so I just said the truth) which was fine, 96% and I've also been asked how much space was the system occupying, which is more than 10GB which they told me could be the cause of the problem since it should be less than 6 (iirc), so I've been told to reset my iPhone. After resetting my iPhone, **what should I tell them when I call them again to make sure that they replace it?** I've also been told that they can check if I've actually resetted my phone, so that's something that I'm going to do.

ULPT- Free and simple money with Ibotta ( Not much but still good),"# Whats Ibotta?

Ibotta is an app that gives you back money with offers from walmart, target, sams club etc. (usually 25 , 50, 75 cents - some offers are $3-$4)

#How Ibotta works

for example there is an offer from walmart on the app for pop tarts for 50 cents. you buy the pop tarts, click on the offer, submit the receipt, and in less than 24 hours the money will be sent to your account if its approved (they check if the receipt is real or not)

But you need at least $20 to transfer it to your PayPal

#How to get free money without spending money on the items

1. Open the app and choose a store you prefer.
2. Check for the highest offer- probably like $4
3. Go to the store, buy the item
4. Redeem the offer 
5. Wait until the offer is approved and the money is transferred to your account.
6. Go return the item (make sure it's returnable tho)

Keep it in your car and when you crash get out and make sure there is a witness (preferably one that arrived after the crash and didn’t actually see you all over the road) and proceed to open the bottle and chug down the tea.    My theory is that you deny any consumption prior to the crash.   So by drinking the tea you won’t impair yourself more but you can claim you were stone cold sober prior to the accident and you will have a logical excuse for elevated blood alcohol levels. The witness will be happy to tell the police what they saw supporting your story. There is nothing majorly illegal about drinking alcohol while waiting outside your car and if there is it’s easier to fight than a DWI.

I was home at the time of delivery, but when Amazon said ‘Delivered’ package was nowhere in sight. So I called UPS within like 20 minutes of supposed delivery, I was nice but upset and told them I really didn’t get it, which was true. They told me to look around my door, go to the leasing office (I live in a big apt complex), I did but nothing. The guy told me he will check with the currier and stuff and mark it as a priority and they will get back to me. 
I went outside to look just through the apt complex, further away from my section and building, knowing that USPS messed up before (not UPS) and just threw it on someone elses doorstep. However, I’ve never asked for any refunds or called anyone and was always able to get the packages the handfull time it happened.

Step 1: Buy a movie ticket at the theater. This has to be done in person and doesn’t work online (fandango, etc) so you’ll have to buy it from the ticket booth 

Step 2: Fold the part of the ticket that gets ripped by the ticket taker, behind the stub (the part that you keep) so it should look like you just have the stub and not a full ticket that’s unripped

Step 3: This part requires a bit of confidence. When walking to the ticket taker, show them your folded ticket and explain that you’re just going back into the theater. Depending on how busy it is you might be able to just walk right by them. Because a stub is basically used as a receipt in case you leave the theater, it looks like you’re returning to the theater after using the restroom or whatever when in reality you’re entering for the first time. Now, if done properly you are now in the theater with an unripped movie ticket. 

Step 4: When the film is over, keep the unripped ticket in your wallet. The next time you see a movie, show your unripped ticket to the ticket booth and explain that you bought your ticket but couldn’t see the movie because [insert excuse here]. The ticket booth worker will (for most theaters) exchange your ticket for a new ticket for whatever film you want to see. 

Step 5: Rinse and repeat for free movies!

I was able to do this over the course of a couple years and saved hundreds of dollars on movies. I think one summer I saw every movie that was released. I did get “caught” a couple times by ticket takers but just play dumb and say “oh I didn’t know it wasn’t ripped, my fault” and you’ll be fine.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1555960777,DeltaRobTV,6,5,True,2019-04-22

ULPT: Want to become a British Citizen ?,"Now before anyone says I'm a racist or what ever. I'm not calm down. I have no problem with people who actually need help and fled their country finding a new home and calling it their own.

This is how it works:
1. People will get a student visa (usually third world country applicants like India, Pakistan etc)
2. Pass the interviews and show they have the funds etc for fees and living to the government. ( This is usually a lie and fake information. I have seen it first hand, they will borrow money from family friends so they can show the gov that they have the funds, once they get their visa the money goes right back to original owner)
3. Getting to the UK, they come to UK with their wife and kids  and will make slight effort, if any, to learn and work full time without paying tax =money under the table.(although they aren't permitted to do so).
4. UK Student visas last 2 years after which you are to return to your country.
5. Many students will falsely apply for an extension of 1 year as they claim they haven't completed the course.
6. During this year they will find a solicitor who has no issue in lying and providing falsified information.
7. They will then make an angle of Asylum, that if they returned to their country they will be killed.( This is most BS excuse in the world.)
8. The government will never check if their claims are true or Investigate it. 99% of time this is a false claim. The government gives in and says sure stay here and take advantage of the NHS and be a citizen without ever contributing to the NHS or UK through tax.

I know this because I had a relative come over in 2011 with their family. They have done all of the above except step 8. At the time we had no idea of what their aim was and they showed up in the UK out of the blue. We met them etc and then things got sour because they're a Nasty piece of work so we haven't been in contact since 2011. They have since been detained by the home office once and were released and moved to a different city to avoid the home office. 2016/2017 they moved back to their original city and are doing the whole asylum thing.
I know their claim is false as I know their family in their home country and I know for a fact no one wants to kill/harm them.

I had a flight from New Orleans to LaGuardia, with a layover in Chicago.  The first flight gets delayed 4 hours. It was supposed to take off at 7:50, but was pushed to 11:30. We then sat taxxiing for another damn half hour.  

Since the first flight was delayed, I had to reschedule the flight from Chicago to LaGuardia. They gave me a new ticket that would have ended boarding  within like 15 minutes of me landing.  Also, the new ticket didn't have a gate number.  Did they really expect me to land, find out the gate number, then sprint all the way to the gate within that small amount of time?

Well anyway, I'm here in Chicago, I rush to find the gate number and hustle there, and now I find out that this flight is delayed too!!!

FUCK United airlines. 

How can I maximize compensation for this train wreck of a travel day?  After it's all said and done, I'll have been traveling for like 13 hours, where it should have been half that.  What should I say to get the most money?",UnethicalLifeProTips,1555703851,griffindor11,24,67,True,2019-04-19

This is really easy if the other person is already being a pain in the ass, but let's say who we're talking about is a trustworthy long-time friend. How would you split them up from someone you're targeting? I keep thinking about how someone could apply consistent pressure on someone's friendships and relationships by eating up their time whenever they're both around, and by doing the things they share together with them both - and then being really good at whatever it is and doing them privately with one person. It's also surprisingly easy to completely fake things like chat logs, but the issue is obviously that they might be the type of people to tell each other ""everything,"" and if those started coming out you'd get called out. You could set up a situation to \*be\* called out a few months down the line, but you'd have to set things up consistently over time to come out on top of that when the other person will try to prove they're fake, right?

- the building is on ground level, I have the smallest office in that building, but it's right at he entrance and near the main room of the two other businesses that are in that building

- I have a large front window facing the entrance/parking lot

- I have a thermostat in my office that controls the heating/cooling for the hallway an adjacent room

- setting up the thermostat to start every morning freezing cold, then raise it up to as high as it'll go for the rest of the afternoon. Rinse, repeat (I pay a fixed monthly fee for my share of the electric use)

- hanging semi offensive posters on the window : 420 is right around the corner, and I have plenty of material for that. Should be a good way to get parents annoyed without affecting the kids. I thought about some more extreme stuff like ""911 was an inside job"" or other similar stuff that I could grab from r/infowarriorsride, but would rather avoid these topics as I strongly despise these (maybe something more along the lines of ""praise Satan"" than ""chemtrails are controlling your mind"")

Things I'd like to avoid :

- going too insane : I live not that far from that office, and will be passing near it from times to times, so can't start an actual war with these people

- something too offensive for kids : the main other tenant is sometype of homework support program, so kids are around pretty often. Don't want to mess with them, but figured it shouldn't be too hard to get the paperwork worried without any harm to the kids (like the signs I mentioned above)

ULPT request : get my landlord to evict me,"I'm renting a office space for a side business I used to do. Long story short I got a new job and won't be doing this side business as much anymore, so I'd like to get out of the lease I'm currently on to avoid paying the next ~4-6months of rent for a space I won't use.


I tried to talk to the landlord who said they'd put it up for rent again, but it's been over a month and they haven't started anything yet (which I kinda understand since from his point of view it's basically just free money for the next months by doing nothing). Afaik I don't have much other legal options..


Basically I'm at the point where I'd like to mess with them to at least get back at them, but ideally get him to realize that it might be less trouble letting me out early.

The current situation is the following :

- the building is on ground level, I have the smallest office in that building, but it's right at he entrance and near the main room of the two other businesses that are in that building

- I have a large front window facing the entrance/parking lot

- I have a thermostat in my office that controls the heating/cooling for the hallway an adjacent room


Here's what I'm considering so far :

- semi loud repetitive music every single day, updated maybe like once a week (found a nice +10hour long version of ""I would walk 500 miles"" on YT, but would appreciate any suggestions

It’s a “he said - she said” situation and the eBay rep said to partially refund him or accept a return, shipping on me. If I fight it eBay will side with the buyer and he will get a refund and keep the camera.

ULPT: unborn fetuses count as dependants according to Income-based repayment on Federal student loans. Get pregnant every year and abort after filing your annual recertification for massive savings!,"So as the title says, if you are struggling to make your student loan payments... Even if you're already on IBR plans, you can lower your payments even further by claiming dependents. Because some right-wing pro-lifers served on the Education Committee, dependents count at conception. So you can lower your monthly payments even further with dependent deductions. Especially useful if you qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. That money is going to get forgiven anyway in 10 years, so pay as little now as you can! Maybe you'll get lucky and get twins or triplets! I'm pretty sure the abortion doesn't cost anything extra and you get to claim all of those fetuses.

It’s relatively simple, upon first meeting just really ham up how great it was for you and (like with Podrick from GoT) say it was so good you couldn’t possibly charge. This will leave any customer feeling like a champ and happy with your service. It is very likely they’ll come back to you thinking they can get more on the freeski. At this point they’ll be hooked and you’ll have to break the news, your boss is super pissed you didn’t charge for the last time.

Squatter's rights, or adverse possession, allow trespassers to enter someone else's property and get title to it without payment or compensation. They can gain access to a right-of-way or to the entire property. Many states, including California, allow squatters to gain legal possession of property as long as they comply with certain legal requirements.
Occupy the property for the required period of time. You must be physically on the premises, and the property must be unused by the original property owner.
Take open, notorious and continuous possession of the property; the possession must be hostile. This means you must let everyone see that you are using the property or improving it for your use. In states such as California, the continuous use must last for at least five years.

ULPT: Photoshop Disney FastPasses to get into any ride you want,"Let me just start off by saying this method takes a little bit of work to pull off, but it gets easy the more you do it. To do this, you'll need a smartphone with My Disney Experience and Adobe Photoshop Mix installed.

Part 1: Find any ride on the app that has the same time you want, reserve it, then screenshot it in the My Plans section. Then still on the app, find the ride you actually want to go on and screenshot the part with the title and the picture.

Part 2: Go into Photoshop, make a new project, select custom canvas and make the size the same size as your phone, only a little taller. Then in Photoshop, add a new image of the first screenshot you made. Then, separate the top and bottom so there is blank space in the middle, then create a new layer and fill it white. Send the white layer to the back. Now add a new layer and choose the second screenshot you made. On the right side, tap on your layer, then hit the cut out button. Drag your finger across the name and picture of the ride you wanted, then hit the check mark. Take the new layer and move it on top of the name and picture of the other ride. Now once you're done hit the share button on the top and save it to your camera roll.

Part 3: Open up your photo and zoom it slightly so you can scroll the image. Close your phone and put it in your pocket. Now go in the FastPass line for the ride you want and scan your ticket or Magic Band. You'll see a blue light on the scanner. Ask what the blue light means and the person will tell you there's a different FastPass for this time, tell him you just swapped the FastPass a couple of seconds ago. Now pull out your phone and show him the photo. It is crucial that you slowly scroll the photo up and down and try not to trigger the photo menu. If you do successfully scroll the photo, the person will think it's the app and he'll believe you. If you don't scroll at all, the person will try to and it'll trigger the photo menu, ruining your attempt.

If you done everything right, the person will let you on. Once you're on, go ahead and cancel the FastPass on the app. You can repeat this as many times you want. I've did this 10 times across Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood Studios with a 100% success rate. Using this method, I was able to get in the FastPass lines for...
* Spaceship Earth
* Soarin'
* Space Mountain
* Pirates of the Caribbean
* Splash Mountain
* Seven Dwarfs' Mine Train
* Big Thunder Mountain Railroad
* Star Tours: The Adventures Continue
* The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror
* Rock n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith

Obviously there's no guarantee this will work 100% of th time, especially once more and more people start doing it. If you do fail trying this, just wait a little bit for the person working the line to swap and try again. Good luck.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1555177253,im_a_philanthropist,8,10,True,2019-04-13

You can't do this if you know absolutely nothing about the topic, obviously, but you can do it after you've read a wikipedia page. 

Makes things a shitload faster and you don't have to use your brain as much. I guarantee you that unless your work looks dodgy for another reason, no professor has time to look up and read the references you cite.

Don't do this with references that are being used by the whole class or ones the lecturer is familiar with obviously. 

I have a distinction average doing this. You might not get the top mark or even a good mark depending on how well you write, but whatever. You'll pass and you can write an essay that should take weeks in one evening.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1554964686,InTheGecko,6,31,True,2019-04-11
ULPT request: help with excuse to not go in to work later,"So I took my boyfriend to the emergency room at around midnight because he was having some concerning symptoms that could’ve been something serious. We went to the ER per his mom’s recommendation and they took forever, then did some blood work and urine just to tell us that he was severely dehydrated. Gave him an IV drip and we left at about 2:30 am and we just got home. 

I already texted my manager and told her I was going to the ER and didn’t know how long I would be there. My issue now is... if I try to go to work now, I’ll get less than 3 hours of sleep and then hate my life in a couple of hours when I have to get up. I have to get up at 6 and it’s currently 3:05 am. My manager replied saying she hopes things are ok and said to let her know if I need the day off tomorrow. 

What do I say to let her know I need the day off? Just saying that I had to stay up late won’t be good enough. I’m perfectly fine with straight up lying as long as it’s believable and relevant to this situation, I would much prefer stretching the truth though. So can anyone think of a reason that an ER would keep a dehydrated person?

ULPT Request: How can I mess with my horrible roommates before I leave this house?,"Long story short, my roommates are crazy. I made the mistake of moving in with a couple and they have domestics once a week (physical and verbal) and create a really negative environment I.e. there's two of them and one of me.  

They're totally passive aggressive, rude, condescending and close minded people. Due to a number of incidents, things have gone down hill, fast. 

I am breaking the lease and getting out of this toxic joint quick smart, but before I leave, I need to do some things to their stuff to seek revenge and make shit even. 

I'm not talking about things like stealing or destroying anything (which I would totally do but I dont want it to come back and bite me in the ass), merely things that would really really annoy them, preferably things that they won't be able to find the source of for a long time. 

An example of this, that I found on reddit one time, is cutting up shrimp and leaving it inconspicuous places throughout the house such as in the curtain rods, under a floor board or in a cushion. I have also considered pouring bleach into all of their plants, or putting a nail into one of their tyres on each of their cars. 

Any other ideas along these lines? It's ok if they know it was me, just don't really want to be done for any crimes ya know.

ULPT Request: How can I avoid repaying 2018 Marketplace Health Insurance tax credits?,"This is going to be on the long side but I'm in a tight spot and could really use some help.

At the end of 2017 I lost my full time job and health insurance. In January 2018 I started a part time position with no health insurance offered. I kept seeing statements in the news/online about financial penalties for not having health insurance and it scared me enough to visit HealthCare.gov and sign up for the cheapest plan offered based on my expected income for 2018. I picked the cheapest on there simply because I knew I'd never use it (read below). At this point I did not fully understand the implications of what I was signing up for, more specifically in terms of the government paying a large portion of this bill.

I found a full time position in May 2018 with health coverage and cancelled my Healthcare.gov plan. In total, the money the government spent toward my healthcare plan occurred Jan - Apr (~$400 per month), and part of May (~$170). I never used this plan once, didn't visit the doctor, etc.

The company where I found my new full time job went bankrupt at the very end of June. I opted not to start a new healthcare.gov plan and went uninsured for the remainder of 2018 after the month of June. I did pick up a second part time job in 2018 but again it offered no healthcare coverage.

This year, 2019, I used two separate free tax prep websites to determine my taxes. According to each, I won't have to pay a penalty after all for not having insurance Jul - Dec. Not sure why, maybe based on my income.

After entering my personal info and W2's, both sites came up with the same state and federal amounts I owed so that seemed to be correct. However, when I input my insurance 1095-A form, the amount I owed in federal taxes went up over ~$1,800 - the full amount the government paid toward the plan I never used. Based on my understanding, I suppose this means I underestimated the amount I’d be making throughout 2018 when I filled out the form on the healthcare.gov site. Now I need to pay back the full amount, ~$1,800.

At this point I’m pretty freaked out. I can not afford anywhere near the ~$1,800 the government is asking back, let alone the fact that I don't agree with this at all. Unfortunately, law is law whether we agree with it or not. I opted to submit my taxes without the 1095-A filed. My hope was that maybe nobody would notice, maybe if the IRS noticed they wouldn't pursue it due to the amount...was pretty much hoping for the best.

I filed mid-March then received a letter from the IRS at the beginning of April. Among other things, it says: ""We received your Dec. 31, 2018, Form 1040 federal individual income tax return, but we need more information to process the return accurately. Unless required otherwise, send us your reply within 20 days from the day of this letter."" The letter requests I send in a completed Form 8962 as well as a copy of my Form 1095-A. It also states, ""If you don't reconcile, you won't be eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions to help pay for your Marketplace health insurance coverage and other medical expenses in future years. You may also be required to pay back all or part of the advance payments, which could result in an additional tax due or a reduction of your refund.""

Obviously the part about not receiving credits in the future doesn't bother me. But fines or being required to pay back ~$1,800 does. What are my options from here? If I simply don't respond, will my return never get processed? I'm not expecting a refund, I already paid a few thousand between federal and state taxes. How should I proceed now? Any way to get out of this situation?

Lastly, I would like to state that I'm aware I could start a payment plan with the IRS to repay this money. Clearly I'm posting here because I want to avoid that. I’m 29 years old and couldn’t tell you the last time I went to a doctor’s office. It was probably in elementary school, I legitimately can’t remember. I’m never sick, haven’t had an unexpected accident, and don’t take any medications. To be fully transparent, I don't agree that someone should be penalized for not getting sick. I acknowledge the fact that accidents happen and perhaps one day I'll need to visit the ER. In almost 30 years on this planet, that has never happened to me. Some people are born healthy, some born sick, some get sick over time...everyone is in a different situation. I'm not against helping the less fortunate, but I am against penalizing people for not having insurance. I don't ask you to pay for my repairs when my car breaks down and you shouldn't ask me to pay your health bills when you get sick. Maybe I'm just an asshole, maybe I'm too frugal, maybe I make too little money and pinch pennies too much to pay $1,800+ for a service I didn't want nor use - at this point I'm really not sure.

Either way, I'm now in this situation and would really appreciate any advice! Thank you for reading.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1554995507,ProudNet,0,1,True,2019-04-11

ULPT Request: College scholarships,"So I come from a small town, less than 15k people in it with a guy that is worth over half a billion dollars. He has a foundation that gives out scholarships to the local high school kids with half decent grades. I received this scholarship

&amp;#x200B;

For a few reasons, my grades aren't quite what they should be, and I am at risk of losing it. To renew it, all they do is ask you to update this spreadsheet template they provide, screenshot your school's website showing your grades, and email the two files. Hypothetically, I heard someone may have been thinking about hitting em with the ole 'inspect element' and change a few things. Without this money, Im not sure I can keep going to school. I'm wondering: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. What kind of trouble would I be in if I got caught? I'm not sure if this is ULPT territory or ILPT. And Just reiterating, it is just a guy who happens to be from my town, it's not money from the state or anything of the sort. This may or may not be relevant but Im including it just in case
2. Could I just play stupid and say there must have been something wrong with the site or grades must have been put in late?
3. Do you have any other tips if this is a really shit plan? I figure if everyone says this is a horrible idea I can just try to explain my situation and beg and plead with someone at the foundation, but I'm open to suggestions.

ULPT Request: Real Tips,"I dont mean to sound mean, cocky, arrogant or anything, but most of the stuff that's posted on here is flat out stupid, wouldnt work in actuality or isn't even all that unethical. I just saw a post with thousands of views about picking your nose so a cop wouldnt think you had drugs. A lot of these are entertaining, and maybe that's what this is about, but I want real tips. Perhaps that's something best not done on a forum. In no way do I think I have amazing tips, but I thought I'd include an example of an actionable tip as well as an idea / tip relateing to cops and drugs. 

Tip: Walmart has a 100% money back guarantee on their meat. Furthermore, you dont even need to show them or bring them back said meat. Buy some filet mignons and keep the receipt. Bring the receipt and nothing else to the exchange counter and you will get your money back. Never has the cashier been happy, but I have.

The next one requires a lot of front end work, but, nonetheless sign up to drive for uber. It's easy and you dont ever even have to really drive but if I were especially selling,  I'd recommend doing a couple trips a week. The sticker alone gives you a ton of leeway regarding what part of town you are in or what time you are out during the night. Id hesitate telling a direct lie as there is record of your last trip. In any event, whatever drug(s) you commonly do or may have on you at any given time, take a picture of some of those pills or that weed and report it to uber. If it's not weed, play dumb and write in stating you dont know what it is, and you dont want to throw away medication that someone depends on but you're unsure about it and if you dont hear back your going to throw them away........ if you then keep your stuff stashed somewhere a rider could have stashed it, I think you now have at least a shot in court if you had reported finding three of those whatever a month ago to Uber. And got searched... I havent had to test it out, but I think it will take you further than a bougar.

You may get asked a follow up Q by a curious Colin who's had a bit much to drink (""Hey, it was just a time in my life, I'm over it... pistachio, Colin?""), but not only will you never be offered drugs that night again, you'll boost your cred with the douchebags (""how cool/crazy!

ULPT Request: So I have this neighbor...,"I have a neighbor that lives below me. He is an absolute scumbag in every sense of the word. I guess I'll give some examples to just kinda set the scene...

About a month ago one of his girlfriends guy friends(that I thought she was allowed to have) had given my fiancee and I a sweatshirt that she left at his house. If someone did this for my fiancee I would have been happy that they gave it back. 

This kid literally slammed his fists down on the table and screamed ""I knew it!"" and then proceeded to strip search her when she got home for the next few days.

My fiancee tried to be friends with her but for some reason she would always have to go downstairs to their apartment. I thought it was kinda odd but I didn't really care. My fiancee told me he always had to be in the room to hear what they were talking about.

About a week later she calls me from her work phone(he tracks and monitors everything on her cell phone) and begs me to tell him I was mistaken and she had left her sweatshirt at work. I wasn't real pumped on it but I figured I would do her a favor to end the strip searches and just tell him what he wants to hear.

That did absolutely no good and he literally called her a slut and a bunch of other names while we were walking away.

This brings us to this morning.

My fiancee and I took a taxi somewhere this morning and got home around 6am. It was raining so the blonde girl next to us(his gf is blonde) got out to let us out. As soon as she got out he opened his front window and started calling her a slut because she wouldn't answer her phone(he makes her video chat him the entire taxi ride so he can see who is next to her and she always asks us to say 'hi'"" and the girl that was with us def wasn't his gf. She was pretty pissed and when she got home she sent the gf some info on domestic violence.

Of course this went straight to his phone and he messaged her back saying how he is such a good man but she can just be a real bitch sometimes. He loves pretending to be her.

SO. To get to the actual point of this post. I got his wifi password and can easily connect to it. He also has his outdoor cameras(to watch his girlfriend) connected to it. I'm looking for something I could do to maybe stir up a little mayhem.

ULPT: get a free steak!,"Good afternoon you unethically beautiful motherfuckers!

So, I discovered an ULPT by accident yesterday. Purchased steaks from Kroger on Thursday to cook yesterday (Saturday), discovered they had a serious off smell when unpacking them and called the store. Was told to only bring the receipt or the label from the meat back. I got curious about this and called: 

Kroger

Food lion

Giant 

Safeway 

Sams club 

And told them the same story, was met with like replies. NONE of the stores wanted the meat back. 100% honor system on the validity of your claim. 

So to summarize, buy/eat steak, bring receipt back claiming you were unable to consume it, and either eat steak again, or take your cash back for that free meal you scarfed down while watching Gordon Ramsey demolish some asshole on your pirated internet. 

I imagine you’ll have to spread it around to keep taking advantage, as in, don’t hit the same store over and over, they’re gonna catch on if you do that. 

You’re welcome for dinner, unless you fucked it up and cooked it well done, then, just eat the biggest bag of dicks please.

ULPT Advice: Landlord screwed me out of my security deposit. How to get back?,"So last year I rented a room from this guy and he was weird.  Totally normal at first, but super weird after like a month.  

He didn't work, was always drunk, kicked out the other roommate for no reason and stole his security deposit too, and was always spewing racial and political slurs. 

Just a horrible dude.  He took my security deposit too for no reason. 

I have before and after pics and a picture of our lease, but honestly it's not worth the small claims court fees and time since it's only $550 and I moved 3.5 hours away so I'd have to drive back and forth for the damn court.

Anyways, he advertises his room only on Craigslist.  

I've setup email notifications for posts and whenever he posts his room for rent, I post after so it appears right above. 

I tell everyone the truth with text screenshots and pictures of the guy renting and his house telling people to feel free to email or call me about any details.  

He keeps threatening to sue me for slander, I say go ahead you're all talk you don't have any money to do so because you don't have a job and you stole my security deposit and so I'd like to see you try with all my evidence against you etc.  


Sooo this Craigslist thing is working, I've had multiple people email me about him saying they checked out the room and noped the fuck out because he's crazy and a horrible person.  


Honestly, I really don't want anyone else to rent from him because he's a total prick and he will steal everyone's security deposit. 

What else can I do?  Any ideas how to subtly make this assholes life a little more difficult?

ULPT Request: Getting a service dog after a string of unhelpful therapists?,"Any advice on getting a letter from a legitimate therapist saying that i need a service dog?

Bc after doing a ridiculous amount of research i genuinely believe having a service dog would improve my quality of life exponentially.

I have anxiety, depression, adhd, and something else that none of my therapists have been able to confirm because its *apparently* not their place to do so (even though thats why i wanted to see them) that they think is in the realm of OCD. I struggle going out in public alone, staying home alone, my anxiety makes me unable to drive, and I can never remember to take my medication so Im currently off them.
Sadly even after talking to some therapists neither of them seem to realize how shitty my mental illnesses actually make my life, and they cant really help me *outside* of therapy like i *need*.

My boyfriend has helped a lot but he cant be with me 24/7 and i dont want to put so much strain on him.

So.
